Welcome! I am Xueming Fu (付学明), a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Prof. S. Kevin Zhou and Prof. Gao-Jun Teng.

My research focuses on **3D/4D medical image reconstruction** using novel **3D Gaussian representations** combined with deep learning techniques. I am particularly interested in developing efficient and accurate methods for volumetric medical imaging tasks including cardiac motion tracking, coronary artery reconstruction, and self-supervised representation learning.

## About Me

I received my Bachelor's degree from Xidian University (XDU) in Computer Science and Technology (Computer Vision) in 2019, and my Master's degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in Electronic Science and Technology in 2023, where I worked on physiological signal pattern recognition under the supervision of Prof. Mingming Zhang and Prof. Yefeng Zheng.

I have published **5 first-author papers** (3 accepted, 2 under review), including **1 SCI Q1 Top journal** and **2 CCF-B conference papers** at MICCAI. My research has also contributed to **6 co-authored papers**, including **CVPR 2025 Highlight (CCF-A)** and **Medical Image Analysis (Q1, IF=11.8)**.

## News

- **[2025-03]** Paper "ICP: Immediate Compensation Pruning for Mid-to-high Sparsity" accepted to **CVPR 2025 as Highlight**! (Co-author)
- **[2025-01]** Paper "Dyna3DGR: 4D Cardiac Motion Tracking" accepted to **MICCAI 2025** (CCF-B)
- **[2024-10]** Paper "3DGR-CAR: Coronary Artery Reconstruction" accepted to **MICCAI 2024** (CCF-B)
- **[2024-06]** Awarded **2024 Suzhou Industrial Park Scholarship** at USTC
- **[2023-08]** Started PhD at USTC

## Research Highlights

My research introduces **3D Gaussian representations** to medical imaging, achieving:

- **Parameter Efficiency**: 99% reduction in parameters compared to voxel-based methods
- **Superior Performance**: Outperforming SOTA methods in segmentation, registration, and classification tasks
- **Novel Applications**: First work applying 3D Gaussians to cardiac motion tracking and coronary artery reconstruction
- **Clinical Impact**: Collaborations with hospitals including Jiangsu Provincial Government Hospital and Siemens Healthcare

## Research Interests

- **3D Gaussian Representation for Medical Imaging**: Pioneering the use of 3D Gaussians for volumetric medical image reconstruction
- **4D Cardiac Motion Tracking**: Developing topology-consistent methods for dynamic cardiac MRI analysis
- **Sparse-view 3D Reconstruction**: Reconstructing 3D anatomical structures from ultra-sparse 2D X-ray projections
- **Self-supervised Learning**: Designing Gaussian-based masked autoencoders for medical representation learning
- **Medical Image Synthesis**: GAN-based modality transfer for CT imaging
