I am a PhD candidate at the **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)**, specializing in **3D/4D Medical Image Reconstruction** and **Deep Learning**.

My research focuses on using **3D Gaussian representations** to solve complex medical imaging problems, including cardiac motion tracking and coronary artery reconstruction.
