    description: 'Developed MedGMAE, the first work to introduce 3D Gaussian representations into medical image self-supervised pre-training. Achieved 99% parameter reduction compared to voxel-based methods while outperforming SOTA on downstream tasks. The pre-trained Gaussian decoder demonstrates zero-shot capabilities and accelerates 3DGS-based CT reconstruction by 1.39×.'

    description: 'Pioneered the application of 3D Gaussian representations to coronary artery reconstruction from ultra-sparse X-ray views. Achieved ~70% DSC improvement over NeRF-based methods with 10× faster reconstruction speed. Successfully addressed the challenge of coronary arteries occupying only 0.1% of cardiac volume.'

    description: 'Designed a unified framework for 4D cardiac motion tracking using dynamic 3D Gaussian representations. Introduced control point-based motion model and differentiable volumetric rendering to align representation space with image space. Achieved 17.73% Dice improvement and 12.63% SSIM improvement on dynamic cardiac MRI datasets.'
