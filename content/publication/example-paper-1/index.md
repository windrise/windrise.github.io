abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning. This paper presents a comprehensive review of deep learning methods for medical image segmentation, covering convolutional neural networks, U-Net architectures, and recent transformer-based approaches. We analyze the strengths and limitations of different methods and provide insights for future research directions.

This paper provides a comprehensive review of deep learning approaches for medical image segmentation. We cover the evolution from traditional methods to modern deep learning architectures, including:

- Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN)
- U-Net and its variants
- Attention mechanisms
- Transformer-based models
- Multi-modal segmentation approaches

Our analysis includes extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and provides practical guidelines for researchers and practitioners in the field.
