abstract: Annotated medical imaging data is often scarce and expensive to obtain. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning framework that effectively adapts pre-trained models to medical imaging tasks with limited labeled data. Our approach combines domain adaptation techniques with self-supervised learning to improve model generalization and achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple medical imaging benchmarks.

summary: A transfer learning framework for medical imaging with limited annotated data.
