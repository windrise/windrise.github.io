abstract: While deep learning models have shown impressive performance in medical image analysis, their lack of interpretability limits their clinical adoption. This work presents a novel approach to make deep learning models more interpretable and trustworthy for clinical decision support. We introduce attention-based visualization techniques and uncertainty quantification methods that provide clinicians with meaningful insights into model predictions.

summary: An interpretable deep learning approach for clinical decision support systems.
