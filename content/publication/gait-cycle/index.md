abstract: 'This paper proposes a novel gait cycle-inspired learning strategy for continuous prediction of knee joint trajectory from surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. By incorporating biomechanical knowledge of human gait cycles, our method achieves more accurate and robust joint trajectory prediction, with applications in rehabilitation robotics and exoskeleton control.'

summary: 'Gait cycle-inspired learning for continuous knee joint trajectory prediction from sEMG signals (IEEE T-Cyb, Q1, IF=9.4).'
