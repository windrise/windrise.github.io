abstract: 'This paper presents a muscle synergy-driven adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approach for predicting continuous knee joint movement from sEMG signals. By incorporating muscle synergy theory, our method reduces input dimensionality while maintaining prediction accuracy, providing an efficient solution for real-time joint motion estimation.'

summary: 'Muscle synergy-driven ANFIS for continuous knee joint movement prediction (IEEE T-FS 2022, Q1, IF=10.07).'
