  key_contributions:
  - Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved
    remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based
    on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances
    and classify categories.
  - However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments,
    while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and
    are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory
    fine-grained classification results.
  - Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet)
    to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained
    aspects, enhancing the distinguishability.
