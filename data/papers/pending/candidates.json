      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces that appear plausible, but may hide internal biases. We call these *unverbalized biases*. Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across six LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality). In the same run, the pipeline also validates biases that were manually identified by prior work (gender, race, religion, ethnicity). More broadly, our proposed approach provides a practical, scalable path to automatic task-specific bias discovery.",

However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., \"pick up a bowl and place it on the table\"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI.

      "abstract": "Multiple rotation averaging (MRA) is a fundamental optimization problem in 3D vision and robotics that aims to recover globally consistent absolute rotations from noisy relative measurements. Established classical methods, such as L1-IRLS and Shonan, face limitations including local minima susceptibility and reliance on convex relaxations that fail to preserve the exact manifold geometry, leading to reduced accuracy in high-noise scenarios. We introduce IQARS (Iterative Quantum Annealing for Rotation Synchronization), the first algorithm that reformulates MRA as a sequence of local quadratic non-convex sub-problems executable on quantum annealers after binarization, to leverage inherent hardware advantages. IQARS removes convex relaxation dependence and better preserves non-Euclidean rotation manifold geometry while leveraging quantum tunneling and parallelism for efficient solution space exploration. We evaluate IQARS's performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. While current annealers remain in their nascent phase and only support solving problems of limited scale with constrained performance, we observed that IQARS on D-Wave annealers can already achieve ca. 12% higher accuracy than Shonan, i.e., the best-performing classical method evaluated empirically.",

Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios.

      "abstract": "Scaling action-controllable world models is limited by the scarcity of action labels. While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$Δ$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines.",

This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN. This study reveals the potential of learning transferable world knowledge directly from raw videos, with all code, data, and models to be open-sourced for further research.",

      "abstract": "Data privacy and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are two important aspects for modern Machine Learning systems. To enhance data privacy, recent machine learning models have been designed as a Federated Learning (FL) system. On top of that, additional privacy layers can be added, via Differential Privacy (DP). On the other hand, to improve explainability, ML must consider more interpretable approaches with reduced number of features and less complex internal architecture. In this context, this paper aims to achieve a machine learning (ML) model that combines enhanced data privacy with explainability. So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model. However, there is a side effect adding DP: it harms the explainability of the system. So, this paper also presents the impact of DP protection on the explainability of the ML model. The carried out performance assessment shows improvements of FEXT-DP in terms of a faster training, i.e., numbers of rounds, Mean Squared Error and explainability.",

      "abstract": "Leveraging representation encoders for generative modeling offers a path for efficient, high-fidelity synthesis. However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.

We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is \\emph{leakage-free state prediction}: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.",

We introduce \\textit{Step-Decomposed Influence (SDI)}, which decomposes TracIn into a length-$τ$ influence trajectory by unrolling the recurrent computation graph and attributing influence to specific loop iterations.

Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.",

At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization.

      "abstract": "Developing agents capable of open-endedly discovering and learning novel skills is a grand challenge in Artificial Intelligence. While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average. We will open-source our code and provide additional videos $\\href{https://sites.google.com/view/code-sharp/homepage}{here}$.",

We further develop modular training strategies that leverage supervised finetuning and specialized reinforcement learning to optimize individual capabilities while maintaining effective collaboration. Comprehensive evaluation across 170 subdomains demonstrates that Anagent achieves substantial improvements, up to $\\uparrow 13.43\\%$ in training-free settings and $\\uparrow 42.12\\%$ with finetuning, while revealing that task-oriented reasoning and context-aware problem-solving are essential for high-quality scientific table \\& figure analysis.

      "abstract": "We introduce Forensim, an attention-based state-space framework for image forgery detection that jointly localizes both manipulated (target) and source regions. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on artifact cues to detect spliced or forged areas, Forensim is designed to capture duplication patterns crucial for understanding context. In scenarios such as protest imagery, detecting only the forged region, for example a duplicated act of violence inserted into a peaceful crowd, can mislead interpretation, highlighting the need for joint source-target localization. Forensim outputs three-class masks (pristine, source, target) and supports detection of both splicing and copy-move forgeries within a unified architecture. We propose a visual state-space model that leverages normalized attention maps to identify internal similarities, paired with a region-based block attention module to distinguish manipulated regions. This design enables end-to-end training and precise localization. Forensim achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.

Such features are traditionally used for test-time monitoring or steering. We present an alternative affordance: features as scalable supervision for open-ended tasks. We consider the case of hallucination-reduction as a desirable, yet open-ended behavior and design a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline, titled RLFR (Reinforcement Learning from Feature Rewards), that uses features as reward functions. Grounded in a novel probing framework that identifies candidate hallucinated claims, our pipeline teaches a model to intervene and correct its completions when it is uncertain of their factuality. Furthermore, the pipeline enables scalable test-time compute, guided once more by our reward features. This end-to-end process operationalized on Gemma-3-12B-IT results in a policy that is 58% less likely to hallucinate compared to the original model, while preserving performance on standard benchmarks. Taken together, by grounding supervision in the language of features, this paper introduces a novel paradigm in the use of interpretability for learning open-ended tasks.",

      "abstract": "Human problem-solving is never the repetition of a single mindset, by which we mean a distinct mode of cognitive processing. When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\\% and 4.72\\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

Existing post-hoc detectors typically rely on model confidence scores or likelihood estimates in feature space, often under restrictive distributional assumptions. In this work, we introduce a third paradigm and formulate OOD detection from a diversity perspective. We propose the Vendi Novelty Score (VNS), an OOD detector based on the Vendi Scores (VS), a family of similarity-based diversity metrics. VNS quantifies how much a test sample increases the VS of the in-distribution feature set, providing a principled notion of novelty that does not require density modeling. VNS is linear-time, non-parametric, and naturally combines class-conditional (local) and dataset-level (global) novelty signals. Across multiple image classification benchmarks and network architectures, VNS achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance. Remarkably, VNS retains this performance when computed using only 1% of the training data, enabling deployment in memory- or access-constrained settings.",

The selected models reflect diverse unsupervised disentanglement strategies, including inductive biases, data augmentations, adversarial objectives, and staged training procedures. We further isolate specific strategies to analyze their effect. Our analysis spans four key axes: informativeness, equivariance, invariance, and disentanglement, which are assessed across datasets, tasks, and controlled transformations. Our findings reveal inconsistencies between intended and actual semantics of the embeddings, suggesting that current strategies fall short of producing truly disentangled representations, and prompting a re-examination of how controllability is approached in music generation.",

While attention is a staple of modern network architectures, it is also notoriously expensive to deploy due to resource requirements that scale quadratically with the input sequence length $n$. WildCat avoids these quadratic costs by only attending over a small weighted coreset. Crucially, we select the coreset using a fast but spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm -- randomly pivoted Cholesky -- and weight the elements optimally to minimise reconstruction error. Remarkably, given bounded inputs, WildCat approximates exact attention with super-polynomial $O(n^{-\\sqrt{\\log(\\log(n))}})$ error decay while running in near-linear $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ time. In contrast, prior practical approximations either lack error guarantees or require quadratic runtime to guarantee such high fidelity. We couple this advance with a GPU-optimized PyTorch implementation and a suite of benchmark experiments demonstrating the benefits of WildCat for image generation, image classification, and language model KV cache compression.",

Our approach modifies standard self-attention to process spatio-temporal feature sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring minimal changes to existing architectures. STA demonstrates broad applicability across diverse transformer architectures and remains effective across both lightweight and larger-scale models. A comprehensive evaluation on the Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets shows substantial improvements of 9.20 percentage points in temporal consistency metrics and up to 1.76 percentage points in mean intersection over union compared to single-frame baselines. These results demonstrate STA as an effective architectural enhancement for video-based semantic segmentation applications.",

      "abstract": "Efficient exploration remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in sparse-reward environments. We introduce Optimistic World Models (OWMs), a principled and scalable framework for optimistic exploration that brings classical reward-biased maximum likelihood estimation (RBMLE) from adaptive control into deep RL. In contrast to upper confidence bound (UCB)-style exploration methods, OWMs incorporate optimism directly into model learning by augmentation with an optimistic dynamics loss that biases imagined transitions toward higher-reward outcomes. This fully gradient-based loss requires neither uncertainty estimates nor constrained optimization. Our approach is plug-and-play with existing world model frameworks, preserving scalability while requiring only minimal modifications to standard training procedures. We instantiate OWMs within two state-of-the-art world model architectures, leading to Optimistic DreamerV3 and Optimistic STORM, which demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and cumulative return compared to their baseline counterparts.",

      "abstract": "Head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely collected and shared for research under strict regulatory frameworks. These frameworks require removing potential identifiers before sharing. But, even after skull stripping, the brain parenchyma contains unique signatures that can match other MRIs from the same participants across databases, posing a privacy risk if additional data features are available. Current regulatory frameworks often mandate evaluating such risks based on the assessment of a certain level of reasonableness. Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods.\n  Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation. Nearly perfect linkage accuracy was achieved in matching data samples across various time intervals, scanner types, spatial resolutions, and acquisition protocols, despite potential cognitive decline, simulating MRI matching across databases. These results aim to contribute meaningfully to the development of thoughtful, forward-looking policies in medical data sharing.",

However, excessively lengthy reasoning incurs substantial resource overhead, including token consumption and latency, which is particularly redundant when handling obviously generated forgeries. To address this issue, we propose Fake-HR1, a large-scale hybrid-reasoning model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adaptively determine whether reasoning is necessary based on the characteristics of the generative detection task. To achieve this, we design a two-stage training framework: we first perform Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) for cold-start initialization, followed by online reinforcement learning with Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization (HGRPO) to implicitly learn when to select an appropriate reasoning mode. Experimental results show that Fake-HR1 adaptively performs reasoning across different types of queries, surpassing existing LLMs in both reasoning ability and generative detection performance, while significantly improving response efficiency.",

      "abstract": "In black-box combinatorial optimization, objective evaluations are often expensive, so high quality solutions must be found under a limited budget. Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.",

We address this problem by presenting a certified pose estimation in 3D solely from a camera image and a well-known target geometry. This is realized by formally bounding the pose, which is computed by leveraging recent results from reachability analysis and formal neural network verification. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach efficiently and accurately localizes agents in both synthetic and real-world experiments.",

This paper argues that this divide is mostly artificial, hindering progress in the field. We propose a viewpoint in which both MPNNs and spectral GNNs are understood as different parametrizations of permutation-equivariant operators acting on graph signals. From this perspective, many popular architectures are equivalent in expressive power, while genuine gaps arise only in specific regimes. We further argue that MPNNs and spectral GNNs offer complementary strengths. That is, MPNNs provide a natural language for discrete structure and expressivity analysis using tools from logic and graph isomorphism research, while the spectral perspective provides principled tools for understanding smoothing, bottlenecks, stability, and community structure. Overall, we posit that progress in graph learning will be accelerated by clearly understanding the key similarities and differences between these two types of GNNs, and by working towards unifying these perspectives within a common theoretical and conceptual framework rather than treating them as competing paradigms.",

Existing solutions, ranging from non-parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to parametric knowledge editing, are often constrained in practice by finite context windows, retriever noise, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose DRIFT, a novel dual-model architecture designed to explicitly decouple knowledge extraction from the reasoning process. Unlike static prompt compression, DRIFT employs a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens conditioned on the query. These dense representations are projected into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw, redundant text while maintaining inference accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRIFT significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, outperforming strong baselines among comparably sized models. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient paradigm for extending the effective context window and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lancelot-Xie/DRIFT.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has become a cornerstone technique for developing reasoning models in complex tasks, ranging from mathematical problem-solving to imaginary reasoning. The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{ADORA} (\\textbf{A}dvantage \\textbf{D}ynamics via \\textbf{O}nline \\textbf{R}ollout \\textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework. It significantly enhances long reasoning in both geometric and mathematical tasks, consistently achieving notable performance gains without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning.",

We present RoboSubtaskNet, a multi-stage human-to-robot sub-task segmentation framework that couples attention-enhanced I3D features (RGB plus optical flow) with a modified MS-TCN employing a Fibonacci dilation schedule to capture better short-horizon transitions such as reach-pick-place. The network is trained with a composite objective comprising cross-entropy and temporal regularizers (truncated MSE and a transition-aware term) to reduce over-segmentation and to encourage valid sub-task progressions. To close the gap between vision benchmarks and control, we introduce RoboSubtask, a dataset of healthcare and industrial demonstrations annotated at the sub-task level and designed for deterministic mapping to manipulator primitives. Empirically, RoboSubtaskNet outperforms MS-TCN and MS-TCN++ on GTEA and our RoboSubtask benchmark (boundary-sensitive and sequence metrics), while remaining competitive on the long-horizon Breakfast benchmark. Specifically, RoboSubtaskNet attains F1 @ 50 = 79.5%, Edit = 88.6%, Acc = 78.9% on GTEA; F1 @ 50 = 30.4%, Edit = 52.0%, Acc = 53.5% on Breakfast; and F1 @ 50 = 94.2%, Edit = 95.6%, Acc = 92.2% on RoboSubtask.

We make progress toward this goal by modeling each round of self-improvement as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on a reward-filtered distribution and deriving finite-sample guarantees for the expected reward. Our analysis reveals an explicit feedback loop where better models accept more data per iteration, supporting sustained self-improvement while explaining eventual saturation of such improvement. Adopting a task-centric view by considering reasoning tasks with multiple difficulty levels, we further prove quantifiable conditions on model initialization, task difficulty, and sample budget where easy-to-hard curricula provably achieve better guarantees than training on fixed mixtures of tasks.

This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems. We demonstrate how this method enables LMs to generate effective reward programs from goals specified in natural language, which may be used within the context of planning or supervised learning.",

      "abstract": "Lane changing in dense traffic is a significant challenge for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Existing lane change controllers primarily either ensure safety or collaboratively improve traffic efficiency, but do not consider these conflicting objectives together. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Safety Shield (MASS), designed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enable safe and collaborative lane changes. The MASS enables collaboration by capturing multi-agent interactions among CAVs through interaction topologies constructed as a graph using a simple algorithm. Further, a state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) lane change controller is extended by integrating MASS to ensure safety and defining a customised reward function to prioritise efficiency improvements. As a result, we propose a lane change controller, known as MARL-MASS, and evaluate it in a congested on-ramp merging simulation. The results demonstrate that MASS enables collaborative lane changes with safety guarantees by strictly respecting the safety constraints. Moreover, the proposed custom reward function improves the stability of MARL policies trained with a safety shield. Overall, by encouraging the exploration of a collaborative lane change policy while respecting safety constraints, MARL-MASS effectively balances the trade-off between ensuring safety and improving traffic efficiency in congested traffic.

      "abstract": "Building a search relevance model that achieves both low latency and high performance is a long-standing challenge in the search industry. To satisfy the millisecond-level response requirements of online systems while retaining the interpretable reasoning traces of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel \\textbf{Answer-First, Reason Later (AFRL)} paradigm. This paradigm requires the model to output the definitive relevance score in the very first token, followed by a structured logical explanation. Inspired by the success of reasoning models, we adopt a \"Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) + Reinforcement Learning (RL)\" pipeline to achieve AFRL. However, directly applying existing RL training often leads to \\textbf{mode collapse} in the search relevance task, where the model forgets complex long-tail rules in pursuit of high rewards. From an information theory perspective: RL inherently minimizes the \\textbf{Reverse KL divergence}, which tends to seek probability peaks (mode-seeking) and is prone to \"reward hacking.\" On the other hand, SFT minimizes the \\textbf{Forward KL divergence}, forcing the model to cover the data distribution (mode-covering) and effectively anchoring expert rules. Based on this insight, we propose a \\textbf{Mode-Balanced Optimization} strategy, incorporating an SFT auxiliary loss into Stepwise-GRPO training to balance these two properties. Furthermore, we construct an automated instruction evolution system and a multi-stage curriculum to ensure expert-level data quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 32B teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the AFRL architecture enables efficient knowledge distillation, successfully transferring expert-level logic to a 0.6B model, thereby reconciling reasoning depth with deployment latency.",

We introduce Early-Stopping for Token-Aware Reasoning (ESTAR), which detects and reduces such reasoning redundancy to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Our method combines (i) a trajectory-based classifier that identifies when reasoning can be safely stopped, (ii) supervised fine-tuning to teach LRMs to propose self-generated <stop> signals, and (iii) <stop>-aware reinforcement learning that truncates rollouts at self-generated stop points with compute-aware rewards. Experiments on four reasoning datasets show that ESTAR reduces reasoning length by about 3.7x (from 4,799 to 1,290) while preserving accuracy (74.9% vs. 74.2%), with strong cross-domain generalization.

According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \\poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \\poshbench performance. Our findings challenge the claim that innate syntax is the only possible route to generalization, while suggesting that human-like data efficiency requires inductive biases beyond those tested here.",

On CIFAR-10, we show that making subtle edits via Infusion to just 0.2% (100/45,000) of the training documents can be competitive with the baseline of inserting a small number of explicit behavior examples. We also find that Infusion transfers across architectures (ResNet $\\leftrightarrow$ CNN), suggesting a single poisoned corpus can affect multiple independently trained models. In preliminary language experiments, we characterize when our approach increases the probability of target behaviors and when it fails, finding it most effective at amplifying behaviors the model has already learned.

In order to supervise a system that is already in operation, monitoring frameworks are frequently employed.

This work proposes an online monitoring framework to detect anomalies in object state representations. Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations. This framework is particularly useful for applications in real-world environments, where new or unknown anomalies may occur during operation for which there are no labels available. Experiments performed on the publicly available, real-world nuScenes dataset illustrate the framework's capabilities.",

Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our coupled inference framework outperforms resonator networks across a range of synthetic semantic decomposition tasks.",

Unlike standard parametric PINNs that map physical parameters directly to solutions, our method conditions the solver on a latent state optimized to reflect the metric-based separation between regimes, showing ~49% lower physics residual (0.082 vs. 0.160). We train this architecture using a phase-based Alternating Optimization (AO) schedule to manage gradient conflicts between the metric and physics objectives. Preliminary experiments on the Duffing Oscillator demonstrate that while standard baselines suffer from spectral bias and high-capacity Hypernetworks overfit (memorizing data while violating physics), our approach achieves stable convergence with 2.18x lower gradient variance than a multi-output Sobolev Error baseline, and 5x fewer parameters than a hypernetwork-based alternative.",

      "abstract": "Monitoring leftover products provides valuable insights that can be used to optimize future production. This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions. Combining these workflows trains a model that surpasses our fully-supervised baseline model under non-ideal deployment conditions, despite relying only on image-level supervision.",

      "abstract": "We study a canonical multi-task demand learning problem motivated by retail pricing, in which a firm seeks to estimate heterogeneous linear price-response functions across a large collection of decision contexts. Each context is characterized by rich observable covariates yet typically exhibits only limited historical price variation, motivating the use of multi-task learning to borrow strength across tasks. A central challenge in this setting is endogeneity: historical prices are chosen by managers or algorithms and may be arbitrarily correlated with unobserved, task-level demand determinants. Under such confounding by latent fundamentals, commonly used approaches, such as pooled regression and meta-learning, fail to identify causal price effects.\n  We propose a new estimation framework that achieves causal identification despite arbitrary dependence between prices and latent task structure. Our approach, Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), involves carefully designing the information set of a meta-learner to leverage cross-task heterogeneity while accounting for endogenous decision histories. Under a mild restriction on price adaptivity in each task, we establish that this method identifies the conditional mean of the task-specific causal parameters given the designed information set. Our results provide guarantees for large-scale demand estimation with endogenous prices and small per-task samples, offering a principled foundation for deploying causal, data-driven pricing models in operational environments.",

      "abstract": "Accurate modeling of drug release is essential for designing and developing controlled-release systems. Classical models (Fick, Higuchi, Peppas) rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy in complex geometries and release mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Bayesian PINNs (BPINNs) for predicting release from planar, 1D-wrinkled, and 2D-crumpled films. This approach uniquely integrates Fick's diffusion law with limited experimental data to enable accurate long-term predictions from short-term measurements, and is systematically benchmarked against classical drug release models. We embedded Fick's second law into PINN as loss with 10,000 Latin-hypercube collocation points and utilized previously published experimental datasets to assess drug release performance through mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), considering noisy conditions and limited-data scenarios. Our approach reduced mean error by up to 40% relative to classical baselines across all film types. The PINN formulation achieved RMSE <0.05 utilizing only the first 6% of the release time data (reducing 94% of release time required for the experiments) for the planar film. For wrinkled and crumpled films, the PINN reached RMSE <0.05 in 33% of the release time data. BPINNs provide tighter and more reliable uncertainty quantification under noise. By combining physical laws with experimental data, the proposed framework yields highly accurate long-term release predictions from short-term measurements, offering a practical route for accelerated characterization and more efficient early-stage drug release system formulation.",

Exploiting the equivariance of this problem under the orthogonal group $\\mathcal{O}_d$, we obtain a sharp harmonic-analytic characterization of the learning complexity for MIMs with spherically symmetric inputs -- which refines and generalizes previous Gaussian-specific analyses. Specifically, we derive statistical and computational complexity lower bounds within the Statistical Query (SQ) and Low-Degree Polynomial (LDP) frameworks. These bounds decompose naturally across spherical harmonic subspaces. Guided by this decomposition, we construct a family of spectral algorithms based on harmonic tensor unfolding that sequentially recover the latent directions and (nearly) achieve these SQ and LDP lower bounds. Depending on the choice of harmonic degree sequence, these estimators can realize a broad range of trade-offs between sample and runtime complexity. From a technical standpoint, our results build on the semisimple decomposition of the $\\mathcal{O}_d$-action on $L^2 (\\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$ and the intertwining isomorphism between spherical harmonics and traceless symmetric tensors.",

      "abstract": "Urinary bladder cancer surveillance requires tracking tumor sites across repeated interventions, yet the deformable and hollow bladder lacks stable landmarks for orientation. While blood vessels visible during endoscopy offer a patient-specific \"vascular fingerprint\" for navigation, automated segmentation is challenged by imperfect endoscopic data, including sparse labels, artifacts like bubbles or variable lighting, continuous deformation, and mucosal folds that mimic vessels. State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods often fail to address these domain-specific complexities. We introduce a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture that combines Transformers to capture global vessel topology prior with a CNN that learns a residual refinement map to precisely recover thin-vessel details. To prioritize structural connectivity, the Transformer is trained on optimized ground truth data that exclude short and terminal branches. Furthermore, to address data scarcity, we employ a physics-aware pretraining, that is a self-supervised strategy using clinically grounded augmentations on unlabeled data. Evaluated on the BlaVeS dataset, consisting of endoscopic video frames, our approach achieves high accuracy (0.94) and superior precision (0.61) and clDice (0.66) compared to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models. Crucially, our method successfully suppresses false positives from mucosal folds that dynamically appear and vanish as the bladder fills and empties during surgery. Hence, HAC provides the reliable structural stability required for clinical navigation.",

      "abstract": "Clinical decision support requires not only correct answers but also clinically valid reasoning. We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach. Together, results suggest that DRL supports more reliable clinical decision-making in complex reasoning scenarios and offers a practical mechanism for deployment under limited token budgets.",

We address this gap with a lightweight, fully on-device pipeline that converts natural-language commands into reliable manipulation. Our approach has two stages: (i) the instruction to actions module (Instruct2Act), a compact BiLSTM with a multi-head-attention autoencoder that parses an instruction into an ordered sequence of atomic actions (e.g., reach, grasp, move, place); and (ii) the robot action network (RAN), which uses the dynamic adaptive trajectory radial network (DATRN) together with a vision-based environment analyzer (YOLOv8) to generate precise control trajectories for each sub-action. The entire system runs on a modest system with no cloud services. On our custom proprietary dataset, Instruct2Act attains 91.5% sub-actions prediction accuracy while retaining a small footprint. Real-robot evaluations across four tasks (pick-place, pick-pour, wipe, and pick-give) yield an overall 90% success; sub-action inference completes in < 3.8s, with end-to-end executions in 30-60s depending on task complexity. These results demonstrate that fine-grained instruction-to-action parsing, coupled with DATRN-based trajectory generation and vision-guided grounding, provides a practical path to deterministic, real-time manipulation in resource-constrained, single-camera settings.",

Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA.",

      "abstract": "Monocular normal estimation aims to estimate the normal map from a single RGB image of an object under arbitrary lights. Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences. The predicted shading sequences are then converted into normal maps by solving a simple ordinary least-squares problem. To enhance robustness and better handle complex objects, RoSE is trained on a synthetic dataset, MultiShade, with diverse shapes, materials, and light conditions. Experiments demonstrate that RoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmark datasets for object-based monocular normal estimation.",

Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in supporting this training by enabling automatic video-based assessment of surgical skills.

To address this gap, we introduce the Laparoscopic Skill Analysis and Assessment (LASANA) dataset, comprising 1270 stereo video recordings of four basic laparoscopic training tasks. Each recording is annotated with a structured skill rating, aggregated from three independent raters, as well as binary labels indicating the presence or absence of task-specific errors. The majority of recordings originate from a laparoscopic training course, thereby reflecting a natural variation in the skill of participants. To facilitate benchmarking of both existing and novel approaches for video-based skill assessment and error recognition, we provide predefined data splits for each task. Furthermore, we present baseline results from a deep learning model as a reference point for future comparisons.",

We investigate whether their own likelihood of success is recoverable from their internal representations before generation, and if this signal can guide more efficient inference. We train linear probes on pre-generation activations to predict policy-specific success on math and coding tasks, substantially outperforming surface features such as question length and TF-IDF. Using E2H-AMC, which provides both human and model performance on identical problems, we show that models encode a model-specific notion of difficulty that is distinct from human difficulty, and that this distinction increases with extended reasoning. Leveraging these probes, we demonstrate that routing queries across a pool of models can exceed the best-performing model whilst reducing inference cost by up to 70\\% on MATH, showing that internal representations enable practical efficiency gains even when they diverge from human intuitions about difficulty.

The variability in the 3D Morphable models can be controlled by tuning diverse parameters. They are high-level image descriptors, such as shape, texture, illumination, and camera parameters. Previous research in 3D human reconstruction concentrated solely on global face structure or geometry, ignoring face semantic features such as age, gender, and facial landmarks characterizing facial boundaries, curves, dips, and wrinkles.

We conducted an eight-week longitudinal study with 15 undergraduates who used AI to support assigned readings in a course. We collected 838 prompts across 239 reading sessions and developed a coding schema categorizing prompts into four cognitive themes: Decoding, Comprehension, Reasoning, and Metacognition. Comprehension prompts dominated (59.6%), with Reasoning (29.8%), Metacognition (8.5%), and Decoding (2.1%) less frequent. Most sessions (72%) contained exactly three prompts, the required minimum of the reading assignment. Within sessions, students showed natural cognitive progression from comprehension toward reasoning, but this progression was truncated. Across eight weeks, students' engagement patterns remained stable, with substantial individual differences persisting throughout. Qualitative analysis revealed an intention-behavior gap: students recognized that effective prompting required effort but rarely applied this knowledge, with efficiency emerging as the primary driver. Students also strategically triaged their engagement based on interest and academic pressures, exhibiting a novel pattern of reading through AI rather than with it: using AI-generated summaries as primary material to filter which sections merited deeper attention. We discuss design implications for AI reading systems that scaffold sustained cognitive engagement.",

Mind wandering and disengagement can be detrimental to learning outcomes, making their automated detection via video-based indicators a promising approach for real-time learner support. However, machine learning-based approaches often require sharing sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling decentralized model training while also distributing computational load. We propose a framework exploiting cross-device federated learning to address different manifestations of behavioral and cognitive disengagement during remote learning, specifically behavioral disengagement, mind wandering, and boredom. We fit video-based cognitive disengagement detection models using facial expressions and gaze features. By adopting federated learning, we safeguard users' data privacy through privacy-by-design and introduce a novel solution with the potential for real-time learner support. We further address challenges posed by eyeglasses by incorporating related features, enhancing overall model performance. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five datasets and benchmark multiple federated learning algorithms. Our results show great promise for privacy-preserving educational technologies promoting learner engagement.",

      "abstract": "To mitigate the trade-offs between performance and costs, LLM providers route user tasks to different models based on task difficulty and latency. We study the effect of LLM routing with respect to user behavior. We propose a game between an LLM provider with two models (standard and reasoning) and a user who can re-prompt or abandon tasks if the routed model cannot solve them. The user's goal is to maximize their utility minus the delay from using the model, while the provider minimizes the cost of servicing the user. We solve this Stackelberg game by fully characterizing the user best response and simplifying the provider problem. We observe that in nearly all cases, the optimal routing policy involves a static policy with no cascading that depends on the expected utility of the models to the user. Furthermore, we reveal a misalignment gap between the provider-optimal and user-preferred routes when the user's and provider's rankings of the models with respect to utility and cost differ. Finally, we demonstrate conditions for extreme misalignment where providers are incentivized to throttle the latency of the models to minimize their costs, consequently depressing user utility. The results yield simple threshold rules for single-provider, single-user interactions and clarify when routing, cascading, and throttling help or harm.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce TaCo, the first comprehensive benchmark for Tactile data Codecs. TaCo evaluates 30 compression methods, including off-the-shelf compression algorithms and neural codecs, across five diverse datasets from various sensor types. We systematically assess both lossless and lossy compression schemes on four key tasks: lossless storage, human visualization, material and object classification, and dexterous robotic grasping. Notably, we pioneer the development of data-driven codecs explicitly trained on tactile data, TaCo-LL (lossless) and TaCo-L (lossy). Results have validated the superior performance of our TaCo-LL and TaCo-L.

We propose Stemphonic, a diffusion-/flow-based framework that overcomes this trade-off and generates a variable set of synchronized stems in one inference pass. During training, we treat each stem as a batch element, group synchronized stems in a batch, and apply a shared noise latent to each group. At inference-time, we use a shared initial noise latent and stem-specific text inputs to generate synchronized multi-stem outputs in one pass. We further expand our approach to enable one-pass conditional multi-stem generation and stem-wise activity controls to empower users to iteratively generate and orchestrate the temporal layering of a mix. We benchmark our results on multiple open-source stem evaluation sets and show that Stemphonic produces higher-quality outputs while accelerating the full mix generation process by 25 to 50%.

However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q.

This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate strong performance on both 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation, and ablations provide practical insights into the key design choices.",

In this paper, BabyMamba-HAR is introduced, a framework comprising two novel lightweight Mamba inspired architectures optimized for resource constrained HAR: (1) CI-BabyMamba-HAR, using a channel independent stem that processes each sensor channel through shared weight, but instance independent transformations to prevent cross channel noise propagation, and (2) Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR, using an early fusion stem that achieves channel count independent computational complexity. Both variants incorporate weight tied bidirectional scanning and lightweight temporal attention pooling. Through evaluation across eight diverse benchmarks, it is demonstrated that Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR achieves 86.52% average macro F1-score with approximately 27K parameters and 2.21M MACs, matching TinyHAR (86.16%) while requiring 11x fewer MACs on high channel datasets. Systematic ablation studies reveal that bidirectional scanning contributes up to 8.42% F1-score improvement, and gated temporal attention provides up to 8.94% F1-score gain over mean pooling. These findings establish practical design principles for deploying selective state space models as efficient TinyML backbones for HAR.",

Using synthetically generated processes with known temporal and cross-sectional dependency structures and varying signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct bootstrapped experiments that enable direct evaluation via out-of-sample correlations with the optimal ground-truth predictor. We show that two-way attention transformers, which alternate between temporal and cross-sectional self-attention, can outperform standard baselines-Lasso, boosting methods, and fully connected multilayer perceptrons-across a wide range of settings, including low signal-to-noise regimes. We further introduce a dynamic sparsification procedure for attention matrices applied during training, and demonstrate that it becomes significantly effective in noisy environments, where the correlation between the target variable and the optimal predictor is on the order of a few percent. Analysis of the learned attention patterns reveals interpretable structure and suggests connections to sparsity-inducing regularization in classical regression, providing insight into why these models generalize effectively under noise.",

However, existing methods exhibit limited exploitation of temporal correlations, causing noticeable flicker and degraded temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates. In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates.",

      "abstract": "Clustering heterogeneous relational data remains a central challenge in graph learning, particularly when interactions involve more than two types of entities. While differentiable modularity objectives such as DMoN have enabled end-to-end community detection on homogeneous and bipartite graphs, extending these approaches to higher-order relational structures remains non-trivial.\n  In this work, we introduce a differentiable formulation of tripartite modularity for graphs composed of three node types connected through mediated interactions. Community structure is defined in terms of weighted co-paths across the tripartite graph, together with an exact factorized computation that avoids the explicit construction of dense third-order tensors. A structural normalization at pivot nodes is introduced to control extreme degree heterogeneity and ensure stable optimization.\n  The resulting objective can be optimized jointly with a graph neural network in an end-to-end manner, while retaining linear complexity in the number of edges. We validate the proposed framework on large-scale urban cadastral data, where it exhibits robust convergence behavior and produces spatially coherent partitions. These results highlight differentiable tripartite modularity as a generic methodological building block for unsupervised clustering of heterogeneous graphs.",

As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction.

To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging semantic reasoning to generate unbounded operators, existing methods fail to construct free-form FE pipelines, remaining confined to isolated subtasks such as feature generation. Most importantly, they are rarely optimized jointly with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of the ML model, leading to greedy \"FE-then-HPO\" workflows that cannot capture strong FE-HPO interactions. In this paper, we present CoFEH, a collaborative framework that interleaves LLM-based FE and Bayesian HPO for robust end-to-end AutoML. CoFEH uses an LLM-driven FE optimizer powered by Tree of Thought (ToT) to explore flexible FE pipelines, a Bayesian optimization (BO) module to solve HPO, and a dynamic optimizer selector that realizes interleaved optimization by adaptively scheduling FE and HPO steps. Crucially, we introduce a mutual conditioning mechanism that shares context between LLM and BO, enabling mutually informed decisions. Experiments show that CoFEH not only outperforms traditional and LLM-based FE baselines, but also achieves superior end-to-end performance under joint optimization.",

First, a retrieval-augmented knowledge module incorporates category-specific textual descriptions into the model input, enabling context-aware reasoning over domain-specific defects. Second, an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism conducts iterative exploration within a compact latent space using optimizable latent think tokens, guided by an entropy-based reward that encourages confident and stable predictions. Furthermore, a dynamic visual injection strategy selectively incorporates the most informative image patches into the latent sequence, directing the reasoning process toward regions critical for anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Reason-IAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chenpeng052/Reason-IAD.",

      "abstract": "Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a central tail-risk measure in stochastic structural mechanics, yet its accurate evaluation under high-dimensional, spatially correlated material uncertainty remains computationally prohibitive for classical Monte Carlo methods. Leveraging bounded-expectation reformulations of CVaR compatible with quantum amplitude estimation, we develop a quantum-enhanced inference framework that casts CVaR evaluation as a statistically consistent, confidence-constrained maximum-likelihood amplitude estimation problem. The proposed method extends iterative quantum amplitude estimation (IQAE) by embedding explicit maximum-likelihood inference within a rigorously controlled interval-tracking architecture. To ensure global correctness under finite-shot noise and the non-injective oscillatory response induced by Grover amplification, we introduce a stabilized inference scheme incorporating multi-hypothesis feasibility tracking, periodic low-depth disambiguation, and a bounded restart mechanism governed by an explicit failure-probability budget. This formulation preserves the quadratic oracle-complexity advantage of amplitude estimation while providing finite-sample confidence guarantees and reduced estimator variance. The framework is demonstrated on benchmark problems with spatially correlated lognormal Young's modulus fields generated using a Nystrom low-rank Gaussian kernel model. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator achieves substantially lower oracle complexity than classical Monte Carlo CVaR estimation at comparable confidence levels, while maintaining rigorous statistical reliability. This work establishes a practically robust and theoretically grounded quantum-enhanced methodology for tail-risk quantification in stochastic continuum mechanics.",

Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation.

Most importantly, our analysis provides direct theoretical evidence that adaptive step-size methods, such as SPS or NGN, are more robust than SGD. This allows us to quantify the advantage of these adaptive methods beyond empirical evaluation.

      "abstract": "The convergence of AI and 6G network automation introduces new challenges in maintaining transparency, fairness, and accountability across multivendor management systems. Although closed-loop AI orchestration improves adaptability and self-optimization, it also creates a responsibility gap, where violations of SLAs cannot be causally attributed to specific agents or vendors. This paper presents a hybrid responsible AI-stochastic learning framework that embeds fairness, robustness, and auditability directly into the network control loop. The framework integrates RAI games with stochastic optimization, enabling dynamic adversarial reweighting and probabilistic exploration across heterogeneous vendor domains. An RAAP continuously records AI-driven decision trajectories and produces dual accountability reports: user-level SLA summaries and operator-level responsibility analytics. Experimental evaluations on synthetic two-class multigroup datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model improves the accuracy of the worst group by up to 10.5\\%. Specifically, hybrid RAI achieved a WGAcc of 60.5\\% and an AvgAcc of 72.7\\%, outperforming traditional RAI-GA (50.0\\%) and ERM (21.5\\%). The audit mechanism successfully traced 99\\% simulated SLA violations to the AI entities responsible, producing both vendor and agent-level accountability indices. These results confirm that the proposed hybrid approach enhances fairness and robustness as well as establishes a concrete accountability framework for autonomous SLA assurance in multivendor 6G networks.",

      "abstract": "Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks largely emphasize semantic matching on daily-life images and offer limited diagnostics of professional knowledge and complex reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce ARK, a benchmark designed to analyze multimodal retrieval from two complementary perspectives: (i) knowledge domains (five domains with 17 subtypes), which characterize the content and expertise retrieval relies on, and (ii) reasoning skills (six categories), which characterize the type of inference over multimodal evidence required to identify the correct candidate. Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks. We further show that simple enhancements such as re-ranking and rewriting yield consistent improvements, but substantial headroom remains.",

Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation. Moreover, SAKED is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into different architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAKED achieves state-of-the-art performance for hallucination mitigation on various models, tasks, and benchmarks.",

However, the high deployment cost hinders their scalability. To tackle the issues, Spatial Interpolation (SI) introduces virtual sensors to infer readings from observed sensors, leveraging graph structure. However, current graph-based SI methods rely on pre-trained models, lack adaptation to larger and unseen graphs at test-time, and overlook test data utilization. To address these issues, we propose PlugSI, a plug-and-play framework that refines test-time graph through two key innovations. First, we design an Unknown Topology Adapter (UTA) that adapts to the new graph structure of each small-batch at test-time, enhancing the generalization of SI pre-trained models. Second, we introduce a Temporal Balance Adapter (TBA) that maintains a stable historical consensus to guide UTA adaptation and prevent drifting caused by noise in the current batch. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate PlugSI can be seamlessly integrated into existing graph-based SI methods and provide significant improvement (e.g., a 10.81% reduction in MAE).",

Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains.",

However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions.",

Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments. This assumption becomes impractical in resource-constrained scenarios where teacher-student interaction opportunities are limited. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode. The results suggest the applicability of our approach in settings where training opportunities are limited.",

This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol.",

We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning. Experiments show that preserving structural correctness remains a fundamental challenge, particularly for diagrams with complex topology, underscoring the need for structure-aware evaluation.",

We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $ρ=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale). Our decomposition reveals distinct bottleneck profiles that suggest different efficiency interventions.",

We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice.",

      "abstract": "Recently, a Symbolic Pattern Planning (SPP) approach was proposed for numeric planning where a pattern (i.e., a finite sequence of actions) suggests a causal order between actions. The pattern is then encoded in a SMT formula whose models correspond to valid plans. If the suggestion by the pattern is inaccurate and no valid plan can be found, the pattern is extended until it contains the causal order of actions in a valid plan, making the approach complete. In this paper, we extend the SPP approach to the temporal planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects (ICEs) fragment, where $(i)$ actions are durative (and thus can overlap over time) and have conditions/effects which can be checked/applied at any time during an action's execution, and $(ii)$ one can specify plan's conditions/effects that must be checked/applied at specific times during the plan execution. Experimental results show that our SPP planner Patty $(i)$ outperforms all other planners in the literature in the majority of temporal domains without ICEs, $(ii)$ obtains comparable results with the SoTA search planner for ICS in literature domains with ICEs, and $(iii)$ outperforms the same planner in a novel domain based on a real-world application.",

However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a key prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease (PD), and video-polysomnography (vPSG) remains the diagnostic gold standard. However, manual sleep staging is particularly challenging in neurodegenerative diseases due to EEG abnormalities and fragmented sleep, making PSG assessments a bottleneck for deploying new RBD screening technologies at scale. We adapted U-Sleep, a deep neural network, for generalizable sleep staging in PD and iRBD. A pretrained U-Sleep model, based on a large publicly available, multisite non-neurodegenerative dataset (PUB; 19,236 PSGs across 12 sites), was fine-tuned on research datasets from two centers (Lundbeck Foundation Parkinson's Disease Research Center (PACE) and the Cologne-Bonn Cohort (CBC); 112 PD, 138 iRBD, 89 age-matched controls. The resulting model was evaluated on an independent dataset from the Danish Center for Sleep Medicine (DCSM; 81 PD, 36 iRBD, 87 sleep-clinic controls). A subset of PSGs with low agreement between the human rater and the model (\\k{appa} < 0.6) was re-scored by a second blinded human rater to identify sources of disagreement. Finally, we applied confidence-based thresholds to optimize REM sleep staging. The pretrained model achieved mean \\k{appa} = 0.81 in PUB, but \\k{appa} = 0.66 when applied directly to PACE/CBC. By fine-tuning the model, we developed a generalized model with \\k{appa} = 0.74 on PACE/CBC (p < 0.001 vs. the pretrained model). In DCSM, mean and median \\k{appa} increased from 0.60 to 0.64 (p < 0.001) and 0.64 to 0.69 (p < 0.001), respectively. In the interrater study, PSGs with low agreement between the model and the initial scorer showed similarly low agreement between human scorers. Applying a confidence threshold increased the proportion of correctly identified REM sleep epochs from 85% to 95.5%, while preserving sufficient (> 5 min) REM sleep for 95% of subjects.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a Toeplitz-based framework for data-driven spectral estimation of linear evolution operators in dynamical systems. Focusing on transfer and Koopman operators from equilibrium trajectories without access to the underlying equations of motion, our method applies Toeplitz filters to the infinitesimal generator to extract eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and spectral measures. Structural prior knowledge, such as self-adjointness or skew-symmetry, can be incorporated by design. The approach is statistically consistent and computationally efficient, leveraging both primal and dual algorithms commonly used in statistical learning. Numerical experiments on deterministic and chaotic systems demonstrate that the framework can recover spectral properties beyond the reach of standard data-driven methods.",

      "abstract": "Scaling up model parameters has long been a prevalent training paradigm driven by the assumption that larger models yield superior generation capabilities. However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting. Our results complement existing evaluations over context compression paradigm, underpinning a breakdown in scaling laws for faithful preservation in open-ended generation.",

We present a novel automated approach using only the total intensity M11 element of the Mueller matrix as an input to a U-Net architecture with a pretrained ResNet-34 encoder. The network was trained to distinguish four classes in the images of murine uterine cervix sections: background, internal os, cervical tissue, and vaginal wall. With only 70 cervical tissue sections, the model achieved 89.71% pixel accuracy and 80.96% mean tissue Dice coefficient on the held-out test dataset. Transfer learning from ImageNet enables accurate segmentation despite limited size of training dataset typical of specialized biomedical imaging. This intensity-based framework requires minimal preprocessing and is readily extensible to other imaging modalities and tissue types, with publicly available graphical annotation tools for practical deployment.",

Are they two views of the same underlying structure? We show they follow a single geometric principle: answer tokens, processed in isolation, encode the directions that would produce them. This Circuit Fingerprint hypothesis enables circuit discovery without gradients or causal intervention -- recovering comparable structure to gradient-based methods through geometric alignment alone. We validate this on standard benchmarks (IOI, SVA, MCQA) across four model families, achieving circuit discovery performance comparable to gradient-based methods. The same directions that identify circuit components also enable controlled steering -- achieving 69.8\\% emotion classification accuracy versus 53.1\\% for instruction prompting while preserving factual accuracy. Beyond method development, this read-write duality reveals that transformer circuits are fundamentally geometric structures: interpretability and controllability are two facets of the same object.",

      "abstract": "Linear probes and sparse autoencoders consistently recover meaningful structure from transformer representations -- yet why should such simple methods succeed in deep, nonlinear systems? We show this is not merely an empirical regularity but a consequence of architectural necessity: transformers communicate information through linear interfaces (attention OV circuits, unembedding matrices), and any semantic feature decoded through such an interface must occupy a context-invariant linear subspace. We formalize this as the \\emph{Invariant Subspace Necessity} theorem and derive the \\emph{Self-Reference Property}: tokens directly provide the geometric direction for their associated features, enabling zero-shot identification of semantic structure without labeled data or learned probes. Empirical validation in eight classification tasks and four model families confirms the alignment between class tokens and semantically related instances. Our framework provides \\textbf{a principled architectural explanation} for why linear interpretability methods work, unifying linear probes and sparse autoencoders.",
