      "abstract": "We study the discrete-to-continuum consistency of the training of shallow graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) on proximity graphs of sampled point clouds under a manifold assumption. Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly infinite width are linear functionals on the space of measures on the parameter space. From this functional-analytic perspective, graph signals are seen as spatial discretizations of functions on the manifold, which leads to a natural notion of training data consistent across graph resolutions. To enable convergence results, the continuum parameter space is chosen as a weakly compact product of unit balls, with Sobolev regularity imposed on the output weight and bias, but not on the convolutional parameter. The corresponding discrete parameter spaces inherit the corresponding spectral decay, and are additionally restricted by a frequency cutoff adapted to the informative spectral window of the graph Laplacians. Under these assumptions, we prove $Γ$-convergence of regularized empirical risk minimization functionals and corresponding convergence of their global minimizers, in the sense of weak convergence of the parameter measures and uniform convergence of the functions over compact sets. This provides a formalization of mesh and sample independence for the training of such networks.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths arising from differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding behaviors. Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.

      "abstract": "Automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) remains difficult due to the large variability of seizure dynamics across patients, recording conditions, and clinical settings. We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance. This work contributes to moving automatic seizure detection models toward clinically viable solutions.",

      "abstract": "We develop a practical framework for distinguishing diffusive stochastic processes from deterministic signals using only a single discrete time series. Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, including general Ito diffusions with nonlinear or state-dependent volatility, but fails sharply for deterministic systems -- thereby providing a theoretically-certfied method of distinguishing between these dynamics, as opposed to the subjective entropy or recurrence based state of the art methods. We construct a robust data-driven diffusion test. The method compares the empirical excursion counts against the theoretical expectation. The resulting ratio $K(\\varepsilon)=N_{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{emp}}/N_{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{theory}}$ is then summarized by a log-log slope deviation measuring the $\\varepsilon^{-2}$ law that provides a classification into diffusion-like or not. We demonstrate the method on canonical stochastic systems, some periodic and chaotic maps and systems with additive white noise, as well as the stochastic Duffing system. The approach is nonparametric, model-free, and relies only on the universal small-scale structure of continuous semimartingales.",

Analysis of distilled trajectories reveals these structures emerge from Long CoT fine-tuning, not keyword imitation. We introduce Effective Semantic Isomers and show that only bonds promoting fast entropy convergence support stable Long CoT learning, while structural competition impairs training.

      "abstract": "In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like \"Pass me the vial\" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

      "abstract": "Representing networks as a graph and training a link prediction model using benign connections is an effective method of anomaly-based intrusion detection. Existing works using this technique have shown great success using temporal graph neural networks and skip-gram-based approaches on random walks. However, random walk-based approaches are unable to incorporate rich edge data, while the GNN-based approaches require large amounts of memory to train. In this work, we propose extending the original insight from random walk-based skip-grams--that random walks through a graph are analogous to sentences in a corpus--to the more modern transformer-based foundation models. Using language models that take advantage of GPU optimizations, we can quickly train a graph foundation model to predict missing tokens in random walks through a network of computers. The graph foundation model is then finetuned for link prediction and used as a network anomaly detector. This new approach allows us to combine the efficiency of random walk-based methods and the rich semantic representation of deep learning methods. This system, which we call CyberGFM, achieved state-of-the-art results on three widely used network anomaly detection datasets, delivering a up to 2$\\times$ improvement in average precision. We found that CyberGFM outperforms all prior works in unsupervised link prediction for network anomaly detection, using the same number of parameters, and with equal or better efficiency than the previous best approaches.",

While adversarial training is a widely adopted defense, its effectiveness under realistic conditions -- where attackers operate with limited knowledge and mismatched data distributions - remains underexplored. In this work, we extend the DUMB -- Dataset soUrces, Model architecture and Balance - and DUMBer methodology to deepfake detection. We evaluate detectors robustness against adversarial attacks under transferability constraints and cross-dataset configuration to extract real-world insights. Our study spans five state-of-the-art detectors (RECCE, SRM, XCeption, UCF, SPSL), three attacks (PGD, FGSM, FPBA), and two datasets (FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF-V2). We analyze both attacker and defender perspectives mapping results to mismatch scenarios. Experiments show that adversarial training strategies reinforce robustness in the in-distribution cases but can also degrade it under cross-dataset configuration depending on the strategy adopted. These findings highlight the need for case-aware defense strategies in real-world applications exposed to adversarial attacks.",

Communities of Interest (CoIs) provide a promising paradigm for organising heterogeneous IoT sensor networks by grouping devices with similar operational and environmental characteristics. This work presents an anomaly detection framework based on the CoI paradigm by grouping sensors into communities using a fused similarity matrix that incorporates temporal correlations via Spearman coefficients, spatial proximity using Gaussian distance decay, and elevation similarities. For each community, representative stations based on the best silhouette are selected and three autoencoder architectures (BiLSTM, LSTM, and MLP) are trained using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with expanding window cross-validation and tested on stations from the same cluster and the best representative stations of other clusters. The models are trained on normal temperature patterns of the data and anomalies are detected through reconstruction error analysis. Experimental results show a robust within-community performance across the evaluated configurations, while variations across communities are observed. Overall, the results support the applicability of community-based model sharing in reducing computational overhead and to analyse model generalisability across IoT sensor networks.",

Conventional registration methods typically rely on iterative optimization of the deformation field, which is time-consuming. Although recent learning-based approaches enable fast and accurate registration during inference, their generalizability remains limited to the specific contrasts observed during training. In this work, we propose an adaptive conditional contrast-agnostic deformable image registration framework (AC-CAR) based on a random convolution-based contrast augmentation scheme. AC-CAR can generalize to arbitrary imaging contrasts without observing them during training. To encourage contrast-invariant feature learning, we propose an adaptive conditional feature modulator (ACFM) that adaptively modulates the features and the contrast-invariant latent regularization to enforce the consistency of the learned feature across different imaging contrasts. Additionally, we enable our framework to provide contrast-agnostic registration uncertainty by integrating a variance network that leverages the contrast-agnostic registration encoder to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of AC-CAR. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-CAR outperforms baseline methods in registration accuracy and exhibits superior generalization to unseen imaging contrasts.

However, the inherent susceptibility of mmWave frequencies to weather-related attenuation, particularly rain fading, complicates the maintenance of stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This creates a critical challenge: making admission decisions under uncertainty regarding future network capacity. To address this, we develop a proactive slice admission control framework for mmWave x-haul networks subject to rain-induced fluctuations. Our objective is to improve network performance, ensure QoS, and optimize revenue, thereby surpassing the limitations of standard reactive approaches. The proposed framework integrates a deep learning predictor of future network conditions with a proactive Q-learning-based slice admission control mechanism. We validate our solution using real-world data from a mmWave x-haul deployment in a dense urban area, incorporating realistic models of link capacity attenuation and dynamic slice demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proactive solution achieves 2-3x higher long-term average revenue under dynamic link conditions, providing a scalable and resilient framework for adaptive admission control.",

DeePM addresses three fundamental challenges in financial learning: (1) it resolves the asynchronous \"ragged filtration\" problem via a Directed Delay (Causal Sieve) mechanism that prioritizes causal impulse-response learning over information freshness; (2) it combats low signal-to-noise ratios via a Macroeconomic Graph Prior, regularizing cross-asset dependence according to economic first principles; and (3) it optimizes a distributionally robust objective where a smooth worst-window penalty serves as a differentiable proxy for Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) - a window-robust utility encouraging strong performance in the most adverse historical subperiods. In large-scale backtests from 2010-2025 on 50 diversified futures with highly realistic transaction costs, DeePM attains net risk-adjusted returns that are roughly twice those of classical trend-following strategies and passive benchmarks, solely using daily closing prices. Furthermore, DeePM improves upon the state-of-the-art Momentum Transformer architecture by roughly fifty percent. The model demonstrates structural resilience across the 2010s \"CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) Winter\" and the post-2020 volatility regime shift, maintaining consistent performance through the pandemic, inflation shocks, and the subsequent higher-for-longer environment.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in video generation have been dominated by diffusion and flow-matching models, which produce high-quality results but remain computationally intensive and difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce VideoAR, the first large-scale Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling. VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger. These results demonstrate that VideoAR narrows the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion paradigms, offering a scalable, efficient, and temporally consistent foundation for future video generation research.",

      "abstract": "The constrained combinatorial multi-armed bandit model has been widely employed to solve problems in wireless networking and related areas, including the problem of wireless scheduling for throughput optimization under unknown channel conditions. Most work in this area uses an algorithm design strategy that combines a bandit learning algorithm with the virtual queue technique to track the throughput constraint violation. These algorithms seek to minimize the virtual queue length in their algorithm design. However, in networks where channel conditions change abruptly, the resulting constraints may become infeasible, leading to unbounded growth in virtual queue lengths. In this paper, we make the key observation that the dynamics of the head-of-line age, i.e. the age of the oldest packet in the virtual queue, make it more robust when used in algorithm design compared to the virtual queue length. We therefore design a learning-based scheduling policy that uses the head-of-line age in place of the virtual queue length. We show that our policy matches state-of-the-art performance under i.i.d. network conditions. Crucially, we also show that the system remains stable even under abrupt changes in channel conditions and can rapidly recover from periods of constraint infeasibility.",

      "abstract": "Domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation is critical for automated ophthalmic diagnosis, yet faces significant challenges from domain shift induced by non-uniform illumination and varying contrast, compounded by the difficulty of preserving fine vessel structures. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot capabilities, existing SAM-based methods rely on simple adapter fine-tuning while overlooking frequency-domain information that encodes domain-invariant features, resulting in degraded generalization under illumination and contrast variations. Furthermore, SAM's direct upsampling inevitably loses fine vessel details. To address these limitations, we propose WaveRNet, a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we devise a Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) that integrates wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens, enabling the separation of illumination-robust low-frequency structures from high-frequency vessel boundaries while facilitating domain-specific feature generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) module that performs intelligent test-time domain selection through wavelet-based frequency similarity and soft-weighted fusion. Finally, we present a Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) that overcomes SAM's upsampling limitation through coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments under the Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets demonstrate that WaveRNet achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance.

In this work, we probe the layer-wise generation dynamics that drive hallucinations and propose a training-free mitigation strategy. Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates. By integrating novel mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention, this work advances the mitigation of hallucinations in LVLMs.",

      "abstract": "Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers, with poor survival rates. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a key diagnostic modality, but its effectiveness is constrained by operator subjectivity. This study evaluates a Vision Transformer-based deep learning segmentation model for pancreatic tumors. Methods: A segmentation model using the USFM framework with a Vision Transformer backbone was trained and validated with 17,367 EUS images (from two public datasets) in 5-fold cross-validation. The model was tested on an independent dataset of 350 EUS images from another public dataset, manually segmented by radiologists. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels. Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean DSC of 0.651 +/- 0.738, IoU of 0.579 +/- 0.658, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5%. For the external validation set, the model achieved a DSC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.634-0.769), IoU of 0.614 (95% CI: 0.590-0.689), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 97.7%. Results were consistent, but 9.7% of cases exhibited erroneous multiple predictions. Conclusions: The Vision Transformer-based model demonstrated strong performance for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS images. However, dataset heterogeneity and limited external validation highlight the need for further refinement, standardization, and prospective studies.",

      "abstract": "Reproducibility remains a persistent challenge in forecasting research and practice, particularly in business and financial analytics where forecasts inform high-stakes decisions. Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet's performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research. It highlights Prophet's role as a methodological building block that supports verification, auditability, and methodological rigor. This work provides researchers and practitioners with a practical reference framework for reproducible forecasting in Python-based research workflows.",

Cedalion is a Python-based open-source framework designed to unify advanced model-based and data-driven analysis of multimodal fNIRS and DOT data within a reproducible, extensible, and community-driven environment. Cedalion integrates forward modelling, photogrammetric optode co-registration, signal processing, GLM Analysis, DOT image reconstruction, and ML-based data-driven methods within a single standardized architecture based on the Python ecosystem. It adheres to SNIRF and BIDS standards, supports cloud-executable Jupyter notebooks, and provides containerized workflows for scalable, fully reproducible analysis pipelines that can be provided alongside original research publications. Cedalion connects established optical-neuroimaging pipelines with ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, enabling seamless multimodal fusion with EEG, MEG, and physiological data. It implements validated algorithms for signal-quality assessment, motion correction, GLM modelling, and DOT reconstruction, complemented by modules for simulation, data augmentation, and multimodal physiology analysis. Automated documentation links each method to its source publication, and continuous-integration testing ensures robustness. This tutorial paper provides seven fully executable notebooks that demonstrate core features. Cedalion offers an open, transparent, and community extensible foundation that supports reproducible, scalable, cloud- and ML-ready fNIRS/DOT workflows for laboratory-based and real-world neuroimaging.",

Focusing on the scientist subset, I show that widely available LLMs with web search and agentic capabilities can link six out of twenty-four interviews to specific scientific works, recovering associated authors and, in some cases, uniquely identifying the interviewees. My contribution is to show that modern LLM-based agents make such re-identification attacks easy and low-effort: off-the-shelf tools can, with a few natural-language prompts, search the web, cross-reference details, and propose likely matches, effectively lowering the technical barrier. Existing safeguards can be bypassed by breaking down the re-identification into benign tasks. I outline the attack at a high level, discuss implications for releasing rich qualitative data in the age of LLM agents, and propose mitigation recommendations and open problems.

      "abstract": "Knowledge distillation involves transferring the predictive capabilities of large, high-performing AI models (teachers) to smaller models (students) that can operate in environments with limited computing power. In this paper, we address the scenario in which only a few classes and their associated intermediate concepts are relevant to distill. This scenario is common in practice, yet few existing distillation methods explicitly focus on the relevant subtask. To address this gap, we introduce 'SubDistill', a new distillation algorithm with improved numerical properties that only distills the relevant components of the teacher model at each layer. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with Convolutional and Transformer models demonstrate that SubDistill outperforms existing layer-wise distillation techniques on a representative set of subtasks. Our benchmark evaluations are complemented by Explainable AI analyses showing that our distilled student models more closely match the decision structure of the original teacher model.",

This paper introduces an Multi-Task Gaussian Processes (MTGP) framework tailored for engineering systems characterized by multi-source, multi-fidelity data, addressing challenges of data sparsity and varying task correlations. The proposed framework leverages inter-task relationships across outputs and fidelity levels to improve predictive performance and reduce computational costs. The framework is validated across three representative scenarios: Forrester function benchmark, 3D ellipsoidal void modeling, and friction-stir welding. By quantifying and leveraging inter-task relationships, the proposed MTGP framework offers a robust and scalable solution for predictive modeling in domains with significant computational and experimental costs, supporting informed decision-making and efficient resource utilization.",

      "abstract": "As machine learning models become increasingly embedded in societal infrastructure, auditing them for bias is of growing importance. However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.\n  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.\n  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk.",

Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%.

Here, we explore the implications of the introduction of LLMs into deliberation augmentation tools, examining their potential to enhance participation through scalability, improve political equality via fair mediation, and foster meaningful deliberation by, for example, surfacing trustworthy information. We also point to key challenges that remain. Ultimately, a range of empirical, technical, and theoretical advancements are needed to fully realize the promise of AI-mediated deliberation for enhancing citizen engagement and strengthening democratic deliberation.",

      "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a promising paradigm for agents, with long-term planning and decision-making emerging as core general-purpose capabilities for adapting to diverse scenarios and tasks. Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.",

      "abstract": "In many problems in physics and engineering, one encounters complicated differential equations with strongly scale-dependent terms for which exact analytical or numerical solutions are not available. A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region. When approximate analytic solutions can be obtained in each patch, they are then matched at the interfaces to construct a global solution. However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in representative problems from chemical kinetics and cosmology, where it accurately reproduces global solutions and outperforms conventional matching procedures.",

We address this challenge by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of alignment generalization under domain shift. We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. Our findings reveal systematic differences in generalization across alignment objectives under domain shift.

We present an expert-designed divorce scenario grounded in Czech family law and evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 3.3 in a fully zero-shot interaction. We deploy two versions of the scenario, one with gendered names and one with neutral labels, to establish a baseline for comparison. We further introduce nine legally relevant factors that vary the factual circumstances of the case and test whether these variations influence the models' proposed shared-parenting ratios. Our preliminary results highlight differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in the outcomes generated by some systems. The findings underscore both the risks associated with laypeople's reliance on LLMs for legal guidance and the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts.

The semantic homogeneity of random rollouts often traps models in narrow, over-optimized behaviors. While existing methods leverage policy entropy to encourage exploration, they face inherent limitations. Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration. Empirical results across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that IIB-LPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by margins of up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics.",

      "abstract": "Sequential Bayesian optimal experimental design (SBOED) for PDE-governed inverse problems is computationally challenging, especially for infinite-dimensional random field parameters. High-fidelity approaches require repeated forward and adjoint PDE solves inside nested Bayesian inversion and design loops. We formulate SBOED as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and learn an amortized design policy via policy-gradient reinforcement learning (PGRL), enabling online design selection from the experiment history without repeatedly solving an SBOED optimization problem. To make policy training and reward evaluation scalable, we combine dual dimension reduction -- active subspace projection for the parameter and principal component analysis for the state -- with an adjusted derivative-informed latent attention neural operator (LANO) surrogate that predicts both the parameter-to-solution map and its Jacobian. We use a Laplace-based D-optimality reward while noting that, in general, other expected-information-gain utilities such as KL divergence can also be used within the same framework. We further introduce an eigenvalue-based evaluation strategy that uses prior samples as proxies for maximum a posteriori (MAP) points, avoiding repeated MAP solves while retaining accurate information-gain estimates. Numerical experiments on sequential multi-sensor placement for contaminant source tracking demonstrate approximately $100\\times$ speedup over high-fidelity finite element methods, improved performance over random sensor placements, and physically interpretable policies that discover an ``upstream'' tracking strategy.",

      "abstract": "Recent deepfake detection methods have increasingly explored frequency domain representations to reveal manipulation artifacts that are difficult to detect in the spatial domain. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on spectral magnitude, implicitly under exploring the role of phase information. In this work, we propose Phase4DFD, a phase aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase magnitude interactions via a learnable attention mechanism. Our approach augments standard RGB input with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude and local binary pattern (LBP) representations to expose subtle synthesis artifacts that remain indistinguishable under spatial analysis alone. Crucially, we introduce an input level phase aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities commonly introduced by synthetic generation to guide the model toward frequency patterns that are most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction. The attended multi domain representation is processed by an efficient BNext M backbone, with optional channel spatial attention applied for semantic feature refinement. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE and DFFD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model Phase4DFD outperforms state of the art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that explicit phase modeling provides complementary and non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only frequency representations.",

Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.",

Conventional single-layer reconstruction methods lock clothing to one identity, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions. We overcome both limitations by encoding each layer as a set of 2D Gaussians for accurate geometry and photorealistic rendering, and inpainting hidden regions with a pretrained 2D diffusion model via score-distillation sampling (SDS). Our three-stage training strategy first reconstructs the coarse canonical garment via single-layer reconstruction, followed by multi-layer training to jointly recover the inner-layer body and outer-layer garment details. Experiments on two 3D human benchmark datasets (4D-Dress, Thuman2.0) show that our approach achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition and recomposition than the previous state-of-the-art, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses, and advancing practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications.

To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations.

To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines.

While many variants of Poisson NMF exist, existing methods assume that the \"parts\" in the decomposition combine additively. This assumption may be natural in some settings, but not in others. Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix). We illustrate these new methods on a variety of real datasets. Our examples show how the choice of link function in Poisson NMF can substantively impact the results, and how in some settings the use of a shifted-log link function may improve interpretability compared with the standard, additive link.",

While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.",

The theoretical impact of concurrent multiply-and-accumulate operations on overall power consumption is evaluated, as well as the success rate of correlation power analysis. Based on the observed behavior, equations are derived that describe how the correlation decreases with increasing levels of parallelism. The applicability of these equations is validated using a vector-multiplication unit implemented on an FPGA.",

This paper investigates whether established EEG classifiers for mental workload and implicit agreement can be transferred to spoken human-AI dialogue. We introduce two conversational paradigms - a Spelling Bee task and a sentence completion task- and an end-to-end pipeline for transcribing, annotating, and aligning word-level conversational events with continuous EEG classifier output. In a pilot study, workload decoding showed interpretable trends during spoken interaction, supporting cross-paradigm transfer. For implicit agreement, we demonstrate continuous application and precise temporal alignment to conversational events, while identifying limitations related to construct transfer and asynchronous application of event-based classifiers. Overall, the results establish feasibility and constraints for integrating passive BCI signals into conversational AI systems.",

      "abstract": "Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) generate high-quality images by operating in a compressed latent space, typically obtained through image tokenizers such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In pursuit of a generation-friendly VAE, recent studies have explored leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as representation alignment targets for VAEs, mirroring the approach commonly adopted for LDMs. Although this yields certain performance gains, using the same alignment target for both VAEs and LDMs overlooks their fundamentally different representational requirements. We advocate that while LDMs benefit from latents retaining high-level semantic concepts, VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement, enabling encoding of attribute-level information in a structured way. To address this, we propose the Semantic disentangled VAE (Send-VAE), explicitly optimized for disentangled representation learning through aligning its latent space with the semantic hierarchy of pre-trained VFMs. Our approach employs a non-linear mapper network to transform VAE latents, aligning them with VFMs to bridge the gap between attribute-level disentanglement and high-level semantics, facilitating effective guidance for VAE learning. We evaluate semantic disentanglement via linear probing on attribute prediction tasks, showing strong correlation with improved generation performance. Finally, using Send-VAE, we train flow-based transformers SiTs; experiments show Send-VAE significantly speeds up training and achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.21 and 1.75 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256x256.",

However, clinical sleep studies are resource intensive and are difficult to scale for population level screening. This paper presents a Dual Pipeline Machine Learning Framework for multi class sleep disorder screening using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset. The framework consists of two parallel processing streams: a statistical pipeline that targets linear separability using Mutual Information and Linear Discriminant Analysis, and a wrapper based pipeline that applies Boruta feature selection with an autoencoder for non linear representation learning. To address class imbalance, we use the hybrid SMOTETomek resampling strategy. In experiments, Extra Trees and K Nearest Neighbors achieved an accuracy of 98.67%, outperforming recent baselines on the same dataset. Statistical testing using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test indicates that the improvement over baseline configurations is significant, and inference latency remains below 400 milliseconds. These results suggest that the proposed dual pipeline design supports accurate and efficient automated screening for non invasive sleep disorder risk stratification.",

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and behavioral patterns. Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on several eye movement datasets, DSTS outperforms both traditional machine learning techniques and more sophisticated deep learning models.",

Each observation is first reconstructed as a linear combination of the other samples in the RKHS, by optimizing a vector form of the Representer Theorem for their autorepresentation property. A separable operator-valued kernel extends the formulation to vector-valued data while retaining the simplicity of a single scalar similarity function. A subsequent kernel-alignment task projects the data into a lower-dimensional latent space whose Gram matrix aims to match the high-dimensional reconstruction kernel, thus transferring the auto-reconstruction geometry of the RKHS to the embedding. Therefore, the proposed algorithms represent an extended approach to the autorepresentation property, exhibited by many natural data, by using and adapting well-known results of Kernel Learning Theory. Numerical experiments on both simulated (concentric circles and swiss-roll) and real (cancer molecular activity and IoT network intrusions) datasets provide empirical evidence of the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories. To ensure physical usability, SceneFoundry employs differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain sufficient walkable space for robotic navigation.

However, access to real systems is often restricted; LLM-simulated environments are prone to hallucinations and inconsistencies; and manually built sandboxes are hard to scale. In this paper, we propose EnvScaler, an automated framework for scalable tool-interaction environments via programmatic synthesis. EnvScaler comprises two components. First, SkelBuilder constructs diverse environment skeletons through topic mining, logic modeling, and quality evaluation. Then, ScenGenerator generates multiple task scenarios and rule-based trajectory validation functions for each environment. With EnvScaler, we synthesize 191 environments and about 7K scenarios, and apply them to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Qwen3 series models. Results on three benchmarks show that EnvScaler significantly improves LLMs' ability to solve tasks in complex environments involving multi-turn, multi-tool interactions.

In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only. Our results indicate that positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default.",

Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits. Additionally, we explore its applicability to protein-RNA and peptide-protein interactions.

This paper proposes Secure and Accurate FEderated learning (SAFE), a federated learning-based approach that protects user privacy by keeping data local during model training. SAFE employs local batch-specific normalization to mitigate cross-subject feature distribution shifts and hence improves model generalization. It further enhances adversarial robustness by introducing perturbations in both the input space and the parameter space through federated adversarial training and adversarial weight perturbation. Experiments on five EEG datasets from motor imagery (MI) and event-related potential (ERP) BCI paradigms demonstrated that SAFE consistently outperformed 14 state-of-the-art approaches in both decoding accuracy and adversarial robustness, while ensuring privacy protection. Notably, it even outperformed centralized training approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. To our knowledge, SAFE is the first algorithm to simultaneously achieve high decoding accuracy, strong adversarial robustness, and reliable privacy protection without using any calibration data from the target subject, making it highly desirable for real-world BCIs.",

      "abstract": "Vision-language models are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents (CUAs) that operate desktops and browsers. Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

      "abstract": "Multi-view multi-label learning frequently suffers from simultaneous feature absence and incomplete annotations, due to challenges in data acquisition and cost-intensive supervision. To tackle the complex yet highly practical problem while overcoming the existing limitations of feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling, we propose an Adaptive Disentangled Representation Learning method (ADRL). ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network. Moreover, ADRL performs prototype-specific feature selection by enabling independent interactions between label embeddings and view representations, accompanied by the generation of pseudo-labels for each category. The structural characteristics of the pseudo-label space are then exploited to guide a discriminative trade-off during view fusion. Finally, extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of ADRL.",

      "abstract": "Algorithm extraction aims to synthesize executable programs directly from models trained on specific algorithmic tasks, enabling de novo algorithm discovery without relying on human-written code. However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases. Collectively, these findings establish the Discrete Transformer as a robust framework for demonstration-free algorithm discovery, offering a rigorous pathway toward Transformer interpretability.",

This study reframes P-wave arrival detection as a self-supervised anomaly detection task to evaluate how architectural variations regulate the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and anomaly discrimination. Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce \"overgeneralization\", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal. In contrast, attention mechanisms prioritize global context over local detail and yield the highest detection performance with an area-under-the-curve of 0.875. The attention-based Variational Autoencoder achieves an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 in the 0 to 40-kilometer near-source range, demonstrating high suitability for immediate early warning applications. These findings establish that architectural constraints favoring global context over pixel-perfect reconstruction are essential for robust, self-supervised P-wave detection.",

In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating how persuasive language generation is affected by recipient gender, sender intent, or output language. We evaluate 13 LLMs and 16 languages using pairwise prompt instructions. We evaluate model responses on 19 categories of persuasive language using an LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology and communication science.

For 2D human pose estimation we report an improvement of 16.3 mAP on the challenging UAV-Human dataset. FlyPose runs with an inference latency of ~20 milliseconds including preprocessing on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit and is deployed onboard a quadrotor UAV during flight experiments.

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which excel at collaborative decision-making and complex problem-solving. Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.",

We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels.

The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities.

Unlike previous semantic SLAM approaches (which embed pre-defined class labels) FeatureSLAM enables entirely new downstream tasks via free-viewpoint, open-set segmentation. Across standard benchmarks, our method achieves real-time tracking, on par with state-of-the-art systems while improving tracking stability and map fidelity without prohibitive compute. Quantitatively, we obtain 9\\% lower pose error and 8\\% higher mapping accuracy compared to recent fixed-set SLAM baselines. Our results confirm that real-time feature-embedded SLAM, is not only valuable for enabling new downstream applications. It also improves the performance of the underlying tracking and mapping subsystems, providing semantic and language masking results that are on-par with offline 3DGS models, alongside state-of-the-art tracking, depth and RGB rendering.",

      "abstract": "Hyper-Connections (HC) generalizes residual connections by introducing dynamic residual matrices that mix information across multiple residual streams, accelerating convergence in deep neural networks. However, unconstrained residual matrices can compromise training stability. To address this, DeepSeek's Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) approximately projects these matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope via iterative Sinkhorn--Knopp (SK) normalization. We identify two limitations of this approach: (i) finite SK iterations do not guarantee exact doubly stochasticity, leaving an approximation gap that can accumulate through network depth and undermine stability; (ii) efficient SK implementation requires highly specialized CUDA kernels, raising engineering barriers and reducing portability. Motivated by the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem, we propose mHC-lite, a simple reparameterization that explicitly constructs doubly stochastic matrices as convex combinations of permutation matrices. This approach guarantees exact doubly stochasticity by construction and can be implemented using only native matrix operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mHC-lite matches or exceeds mHC in performance while achieving higher training throughput with a naive implementation and eliminating the residual instabilities observed in both HC and mHC.

However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.",

Recent work has shown that sequence-level verification leads to a higher number of accepted tokens compared to token-wise verification. However, existing solutions often rely on surrogate approximations or are constrained by partial information, struggling with joint intractability. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a provably lossless verification method that significantly boosts the expected number of accepted tokens and overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches. Our extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks. Moreover, its strong explainability and generality make it readily integrable into a wide range of speculative decoding frameworks. Notably, integrating HSD into EAGLE-3 yields over a 12% performance gain, establishing state-of-the-art decoding efficiency without compromising distribution fidelity.

      "abstract": "Understanding how large language models (LLMs) represent natural language is a central challenge in natural language processing (NLP) research. Many existing methods extract word embeddings from an LLM, visualise the embedding space via point-plots, and compare the relative positions of certain words. However, this approach only considers single words and not whole natural language expressions, thus disregards the context in which a word is used. Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers. Furthermore, our model reveals differences in information flows for tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection. Our results show that our model permits novel insights into how LLMs represent actual natural language expressions, extending the comparison of isolated word embeddings and improving the interpretability of NLP models.",

In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) addresses this problem, but prior work largely focuses on high-resource languages covered during training and text-only settings. This paper investigates whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages with multimodal ICL (MICL), and how this learning can be used to improve ASR. We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities. We further show that cross-lingual transfer learning improves MICL efficiency on target languages without training on them. Moreover, we analyze attention patterns to interpret MICL mechanisms, and we observe layer-dependent preferences between audio and text context, with an overall bias towards text. Finally, we show that prompt-based ASR with speech LLMs performs poorly on unseen languages, motivating a simple ASR system that combines a stronger acoustic model with a speech LLM via MICL-based selection of acoustic hypotheses. Results show that MICL consistently improves ASR performance, and that cross-lingual transfer learning matches or outperforms corpus-trained language models without using target-language data.

Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.",

To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction.

Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.",

To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance. Experiments on semiconductor layouts (ContLayNet), graphic layouts, and SVGs demonstrate AGDC's superior performance in generating high-fidelity hybrid vector representations compared to discretization-based and fixed-schema baselines, achieving scalable high-precision generation across diverse domains.",

      "abstract": "We investigate whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) identify genuine reasoning features in large language models (LLMs). Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance. Together, these results suggest that SAE features identified by contrastive approaches primarily capture linguistic correlates of reasoning rather than the underlying reasoning computations themselves.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid action space, which combines discrete choices and continuous parameters, is prevalent in domains such as robot control and game AI. However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \\textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training. On challenging hybrid action benchmarks, CHDP outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to $19.3\\%$ in success rate.",

      "abstract": "Transferring from a 2-year to a 4-year college is crucial for socioeconomic mobility, yet students often face challenges ensuring their credits are fully recognized, leading to delays in their academic progress and unexpected costs. Determining whether courses at different institutions are equivalent (i.e., articulation) is essential for successful credit transfer, as it minimizes unused credits and increases the likelihood of bachelor's degree completion. However, establishing articulation agreements remains time- and resource-intensive, as all candidate articulations are reviewed manually. Although recent efforts have explored the use of artificial intelligence to support this work, its use in articulation practice remains limited. Given these challenges and the need for scalable support, this study applies artificial intelligence to suggest articulations between institutions in collaboration with the State University of New York system, one of the largest systems of higher education in the US. To develop our methodology, we first surveyed articulation staff and faculty to assess adoption rates of baseline algorithmic recommendations and gather feedback on perceptions and concerns about these recommendations. Building on these insights, we developed a supervised alignment method that addresses superficial matching and institutional biases in catalog descriptions, achieving a 5.5-fold improvement in accuracy over previous methods. Based on articulation predictions of this method and a 61% average surveyed adoption rate among faculty and staff, these findings project a 12-fold increase in valid credit mobility opportunities that would otherwise remain unrealized. This study suggests that stakeholder-informed design of AI in higher education administration can expand student credit mobility and help reshape current institutional decision-making in course articulation.",

In software engineering (SE), these models now support diverse activities, accelerating automation and decision-making. Yet, evidence shows that these models can reproduce or amplify social biases, raising fairness concerns. Recent work on neuron editing has shown that internal activations in pre-trained transformers can be traced and modified to alter model behavior. Building on the concept of knowledge neurons, neurons that encode factual information, we hypothesize the existence of biased neurons that capture stereotypical associations within pre-trained transformers. To test this hypothesis, we build a dataset of biased relations, i.e., triplets encoding stereotypes across nine bias types, and adapt neuron attribution strategies to trace and suppress biased neurons in BERT models. We then assess the impact of suppression on SE tasks. Our findings show that biased knowledge is localized within small neuron subsets, and suppressing them substantially reduces bias with minimal performance loss. This demonstrates that bias in transformers can be traced and mitigated at the neuron level, offering an interpretable approach to fairness in SE.",

With active waiting and message-pace adaptation, Stephanie2 explicitly decides at each step whether to send or wait, and models latency as the sum of thinking time and typing time to achieve more natural pacing. We further introduce a time-window-based dual-agent dialogue system to generate pseudo dialogue histories for human and automatic evaluations.

To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework. Extensive experiments show that HAG significantly outperforms representative baselines, reducing population alignment errors by an average of 37.7% and enhancing sociological consistency by 18.8%.",

To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity. Together, these results highlight the importance of task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling for personalized persuasiveness prediction.",

These factors significantly degrade localisation accuracy, particularly when global models are applied without considering structural constraints. This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning.",

To address both issues, we propose an Open-world Language Knowledge-Aided Robust Single-Cell Foundation Model (OKR-CELL). It is built based on a cross-modal Cell-Language pre-training framework, which comprises two key innovations: (1) leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) based workflow with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches cell textual descriptions using open-world knowledge; (2) devising a Cross-modal Robust Alignment (CRA) objective that incorporates sample reliability assessment, curriculum learning, and coupled momentum contrastive learning to strengthen the model's resistance to noisy data. After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL obtains cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks. Beyond standard benchmarks such as cell clustering, cell-type annotation, batch-effect correction, and few-shot annotation, the model also demonstrates superior performance in broader multi-modal applications, including zero-shot cell-type annotation and bidirectional cell-text retrieval.",

While existing research on machine unlearning has primarily focused on monolingual settings, typically English, multilingual environments introduce additional complexities due to cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases embedded in both pretraining and fine-tuning data. In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages through translation: English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian. These languages span five language families and a wide range of resource levels. Our experiments show that unlearning in high-resource languages is generally more stable, with asymmetric transfer effects observed between typologically related languages. Furthermore, our analysis of linguistic distances indicates that syntactic similarity is the strongest predictor of cross-lingual unlearning behavior.",

      "abstract": "Recent end-to-end autonomous driving approaches have leveraged Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance planning capabilities in complex driving scenarios. However, VLMs are inherently trained as generalist models, lacking specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time. When applied to autonomous driving, these models struggle to establish structured spatial-temporal representations that capture geometric relationships, scene context, and motion patterns critical for safe trajectory planning. To address these limitations, we propose SGDrive, a novel framework that explicitly structures the VLM's representation learning around driving-specific knowledge hierarchies. Built upon a pre-trained VLM backbone, SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy that mirrors human driving cognition: drivers first perceive the overall environment (scene context), then attend to safety-critical agents and their behaviors, and finally formulate short-term goals before executing actions. This hierarchical decomposition provides the structured spatial-temporal representation that generalist VLMs lack, integrating multi-level information into a compact yet comprehensive format for trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that SGDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance among camera-only methods on both PDMS and EPDMS, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical knowledge structuring for adapting generalist VLMs to autonomous driving.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning models for image compression often face practical limitations in hardware-constrained applications. Although these models achieve high-quality reconstructions, they are typically complex, heavyweight, and require substantial training data and computational resources. We propose a methodology to partially compress these networks by reducing the size of their encoders. Our approach uses a simplified knowledge distillation strategy to approximate the latent space of the original models with less data and shorter training, yielding lightweight encoders from heavyweight ones. We evaluate the resulting lightweight encoders across two different architectures on the image compression task. Experiments show that our method preserves reconstruction quality and statistical fidelity better than training lightweight encoders with the original loss, making it practical for resource-limited environments.",

      "abstract": "As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.",

      "abstract": "Conventional Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods aim to infer missing information in incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing information, which struggle to perform effectively in scenarios involving emerging entities. Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs. The experimental results demonstrate that CPSR achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Existing research on continual learning (CL) of a sequence of tasks focuses mainly on dealing with catastrophic forgetting (CF) to balance the learning plasticity of new tasks and the memory stability of old tasks. However, an ideal CL agent should not only be able to overcome CF, but also encourage positive forward and backward knowledge transfer (KT), i.e., using the learned knowledge from previous tasks for the new task learning (namely FKT), and improving the previous tasks' performance with the knowledge of the new task (namely BKT). To this end, this paper first models CL as an optimization problem in which each sequential learning task aims to achieve its optimal performance under the constraint that both FKT and BKT should be positive. It then proposes a novel Enhanced Task Continual Learning (ETCL) method, which achieves forgetting-free and positive KT. Furthermore, the bounds that can lead to negative FKT and BKT are estimated theoretically. Based on the bounds, a new strategy for online task similarity detection is also proposed to facilitate positive KT. To overcome CF, ETCL learns a set of task-specific binary masks to isolate a sparse sub-network for each task while preserving the performance of a dense network for the task. At the beginning of a new task learning, ETCL tries to align the new task's gradient with that of the sub-network of the previous most similar task to ensure positive FKT. By using a new bi-objective optimization strategy and an orthogonal gradient projection method, ETCL updates only the weights of previous similar tasks at the classification layer to achieve positive BKT. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ETCL markedly outperforms strong baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences.",
