      "abstract": "Modern generative video models excel at producing convincing, high-quality outputs, but struggle to maintain multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \\emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \\textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \\emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \\emph{any} viewpoint.

      "abstract": "We present SyncLight, the first method to enable consistent, parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views of a static scene. While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.",

      "abstract": "Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a key component for protecting Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.",

We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

      "abstract": "Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for language modeling, yet they face a performance gap compared to autoregressive models (ARMs) and require more training iterations. In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding.",

This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.",

However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ. Results show that while proprietary frontier models perform best in contextual and policy reasoning, advanced open models are rapidly closing the gap in structured and physics-grounded reasoning.

Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation.",

When multiple VR users share a Wi-Fi network, the resulting uplink and downlink traffic can quickly saturate the channel. This paper investigates the capacity of 802.11 networks for supporting realistic VR streaming workloads across varying frame rates, bitrates, codec settings, and numbers of users. We develop an emulation framework that reproduces Air Light VR (ALVR) operation, where real HEVC video traffic is fed into an 802.11 simulation model. Our findings explore Wi-Fi's performance anomaly and demonstrate that Intra-refresh (IR) coding effectively reduces latency variability and improves QoS, supporting up to 4 concurrent VR users with Constant Bitrate (CBR) 100 Mbps before the channel is saturated.",

To quantify any potential reflection biases, we introduce a permutation-based evaluation framework. With this, we observe that state-of-the-art embedding models exhibit systematic positional and language biases when documents are longer and consist of multiple segments. Specifically, early segments and segments in higher-resource languages like English are over-represented, while later segments and segments in lower-resource languages are marginalized. In our further analysis, we find that the positional bias stems from front-loaded attention distributions in pooling-token embeddings, where early tokens receive more attention. To mitigate this issue, we introduce an inference-time attention calibration method that redistributes attention more evenly across document positions, increasing discoverabiltiy of later segments.

However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation.",

To address this gap, we propose Nishpaksh, an indigenous fairness evaluation tool that operationalizes the Telecommunication Engineering Centre (TEC) Standard for the Evaluation and Rating of Artificial Intelligence Systems. Nishpaksh integrates survey-based risk quantification, contextual threshold determination, and quantitative fairness evaluation into a unified, web-based dashboard. The tool employs vectorized computation, reactive state management, and certification-ready reporting to enable reproducible, audit-grade assessments, thereby addressing a critical post-standardization implementation need. Experimental validation on the COMPAS dataset demonstrates Nishpaksh's effectiveness in identifying attribute-specific bias and generating standardized fairness scores compliant with the TEC framework. The system bridges the gap between research-oriented fairness methodologies and regulatory AI governance in India, marking a significant step toward responsible and auditable AI deployment within critical infrastructure like telecommunications.",

While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.",

We formalize two forces that drive a phase transition toward proxy-sovereign evaluation: verification pressure, when claims outpace verification capacity, and signal shrinkage, when real improvements become hard to separate from noise. In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable. These results motivate actions for tool builders and program chairs: deploy AI as an adversarial auditor that generates auditable verification artifacts and expands effective verification bandwidth, rather than as a score predictor that amplifies claim inflation.",

Our contribution is not to replace cosine similarity, but to restore interpretability of its absolute values through monotone calibration, without altering its ranking properties.\n  We characterize isotonic calibration as an order-preserving reparameterization and prove that all order-based constructions (angular ordering, nearest neighbors, threshold graphs and quantile-based decisions) are invariant under this transformation.",

      "abstract": "The success of reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally tied to having a reward function that accurately reflects the task objective. Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.",

We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs.",

      "abstract": "Crop type maps from satellite remote sensing are important tools for food security, local livelihood support and climate change mitigation in smallholder regions of the world, but most satellite-based methods are not well suited to smallholder conditions. To address this gap, we establish a four-part criteria for a useful embedding-based approach consisting of 1) performance, 2) plausibility, 3) transferability and 4) accessibility and evaluate geospatial foundation model (FM) embeddings -based approaches using TESSERA and AlphaEarth against current baseline methods for a region in the groundnut basin of Senegal. We find that the TESSERA -based approach to land cover and crop type mapping fulfills the selection criteria best, and in one temporal transfer example shows 28% higher accuracy compared to the next best method. These results indicate that TESSERA embeddings are an effective approach for crop type classification and mapping tasks in Senegal.",

      "abstract": "We introduce FedSGM, a unified framework for federated constrained optimization that addresses four major challenges in federated learning (FL): functional constraints, communication bottlenecks, local updates, and partial client participation. Building on the switching gradient method, FedSGM provides projection-free, primal-only updates, avoiding expensive dual-variable tuning or inner solvers. To handle communication limits, FedSGM incorporates bi-directional error feedback, correcting the bias introduced by compression while explicitly understanding the interaction between compression noise and multi-step local updates. We derive convergence guarantees showing that the averaged iterate achieves the canonical $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate, with additional high-probability bounds that decouple optimization progress from sampling noise due to partial participation. Additionally, we introduce a soft switching version of FedSGM to stabilize updates near the feasibility boundary. To our knowledge, FedSGM is the first framework to unify functional constraints, compression, multiple local updates, and partial client participation, establishing a theoretically grounded foundation for constrained federated learning. Finally, we validate the theoretical guarantees of FedSGM via experimentation on Neyman-Pearson classification and constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) tasks.",

However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.",

A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods.",

Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization.

While the approximation power of neural networks is now relatively well understood, training very deep architectures remains challenging due to highly non-convex and often ill-conditioned optimization landscapes. In contrast, for relatively shallow networks, most notably one-hidden-layer $\\texttt{ReLU}$ models, training admits convex reformulations with global guarantees, motivating learning paradigms that improve stability while scaling to depth. MGDL builds upon this insight by training deep networks grade by grade: previously learned grades are frozen, and each new residual block is trained solely to reduce the remaining approximation error, yielding an interpretable and stable hierarchical refinement process. We develop an operator-theoretic foundation for MGDL and prove that, for any continuous target function, there exists a fixed-width multigrade $\\texttt{ReLU}$ scheme whose residuals decrease strictly across grades and converge uniformly to zero. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantee that grade-wise training yields provable vanishing approximation error in deep networks. Numerical experiments further illustrate the theoretical results.",

We formalize this concept, introduce utility and fairness measures tailored to groups, and design heuristic algorithms, such as Pareto-based filtering and grow-and-prune strategies, for efficient explanation discovery. Experiments on MovieLens and Amazon datasets show clear trade-offs: low-cost methods produce larger, less fair explanations, while other approaches yield concise and balanced results at higher cost.

These results are applied to precision-modification-activated backdoor attacks, establishing provable compression thresholds below which such attacks cannot succeed, and show empirically that low-rank compression can reliably activate latent backdoors while preserving full-precision accuracy.

Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor. Validation labels are never used beyond reporting. The probe adds much less than 0.1% of an epoch and works as a drop-in for validation-free checkpoint selection and early stopping.",

We begin with the simplest case, a single-head softmax-attention regressor. We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \\ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance. Finally, we show that multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable from value queries in general -- distinct parameterisations can induce the same input-output map. Hence, guarantees analogous to the single-head setting are impossible without additional structural assumptions.",

At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier.

      "abstract": "Despite their sophisticated heuristics, boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers are still vulnerable to symmetry, causing them to visit search regions that are symmetric to ones already explored. While symmetry handling is routine in other solving paradigms, integrating it into state-of-the-art proof-producing SAT solvers is difficult: added reasoning must be fast, non-interfering with solver heuristics, and compatible with formal proof logging. To address these issues, we present a practical static symmetry breaking approach based on orbitopal fixing, a technique adapted from mixed-integer programming. Our approach adds only unit clauses, which minimizes downstream slowdowns, and it emits succinct proof certificates in the substitution redundancy proof system. Implemented in the satsuma tool, our methods deliver consistent speedups on symmetry-rich benchmarks with negligible regressions elsewhere.",

At the same time, reasoning-oriented LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have achieved notable improvements across a range of benchmarks. This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for evaluating social-cognitive behavior in LLMs.",

Specifically, we target the generation of adversarial instances where these heuristics perform poorly. By iterating on FunSearch's outputs, we identify improved constructions for hierarchical $k$-median clustering, bin packing, the knapsack problem, and a generalization of Lovász's gasoline problem - some of these have not seen much improvement for over a decade, despite intermittent attention. These results illustrate how expert oversight can effectively extrapolate algorithmic insights from LLM-based evolutionary methods to break long-standing barriers.\n  Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs provide critical initial patterns, human expertise is essential for transforming these patterns into mathematically rigorous and insightful constructions.

To address the gap, we introduce ColorConceptBench, a new human-annotated benchmark to systematically evaluate color-concept associations through the lens of probabilistic color distributions. ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance). This demonstrates that achieving human-like color semantics requires more than larger models, but demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning.",

      "abstract": "Reliable wall-to-wall biomass mapping from NASA's GEDI mission requires interpolating sparse LiDAR observations across heterogeneous landscapes. While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.\n  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data. This work provides a scalable, theoretically rigorous alternative to ensemble variance for continental scale earth observation.",

We found that these relationships took varied forms, from one-to-one to one-to-many, and were shaped by multiple actors, including creators, platforms, and moderators. AI partners were perceived as having agency, actively negotiating privacy boundaries with participants and sometimes encouraging disclosure of personal details. As intimacy deepened, these boundaries became more permeable, though some participants voiced concerns such as conversation exposure and sought to preserve anonymity. Overall, platform affordances and diverse romantic dynamics expand the privacy landscape, underscoring the need to rethink how privacy is constructed in human-AI intimacy.",

We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution. Furthermore, while reasoning-augmented inference improves performance, its marginal benefit per token decreases with distributional proximity. These results suggest current architectures remain limited in systematic generalization, highlighting the need for mechanisms beyond scale to achieve robust fluid intelligence.",

We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design.",

A prevailing hypothesis within the software engineering community suggests this code is \"disposable\", meaning it is merged quickly but discarded shortly thereafter. If true, organizations risk shifting maintenance burden from generation to post-deployment remediation. We investigate this hypothesis through survival analysis of 201 open-source projects, tracking over 200,000 code units authored by AI agents versus humans. Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p < 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cramér's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics. The bottleneck for agent-generated code may not be generation quality, but the organizational practices that govern its long-term evolution.",

However, prior research has pointed to the high sensitivity of T2I towards particular input languages - when faced with languages other than English (i.e., different surface forms of the same prompt), T2I models often produce culturally stereotypical depictions, prioritizing the surface over the prompt's semantics. Yet a comprehensive analysis of this behavior, which we dub Surface-over-Semantics (SoS), is missing. We present the first analysis of T2I models' SoS tendencies. To this end, we create a set of prompts covering 171 cultural identities, translated into 14 languages, and use it to prompt seven T2I models. To quantify SoS tendencies across models, languages, and cultures, we introduce a novel measure and analyze how the tendencies we identify manifest visually. We show that all but one model exhibit strong surface-level tendency in at least two languages, with this effect intensifying across the layers of T2I text encoders. Moreover, these surface tendencies frequently correlate with stereotypical visual depictions.",

We present a probabilistic, risk-based access control architecture that couples machine learning inference with mandatory access control to regulate encryption on Linux in real time. The system builds a specialized dataset from the native ftrace framework using the function_graph tracer, yielding high-resolution kernel-function execution traces augmented with resource and I/O counters. These traces support both a supervised classifier and interpretable rules that drive an SELinux policy via lightweight booleans, enabling context-sensitive permit/deny decisions at the moment encryption begins. Compared to approaches centered on sandboxing, hypervisor introspection, or coarse system-call telemetry, the function-level tracing we adopt provides finer behavioral granularity than syscall-only telemetry while avoiding the virtualization/VMI overhead of sandbox-based approaches. Our current user-space prototype has a non-trivial footprint under burst I/O; we quantify it and recognize that a production kernel-space solution should aim to address this. We detail dataset construction, model training and rule extraction, and the run-time integration that gates file writes for suspect encryption while preserving benign cryptographic workflows. During evaluation, the two-layer composition retains model-level detection quality while delivering rule-like responsiveness; we also quantify operational footprint and outline engineering steps to reduce CPU and memory overhead for enterprise deployment. The result is a practical path from behavioral tracing and learning to enforceable, explainable, and risk-proportionate encryption control on production Linux systems.",

      "abstract": "As an important and challenging problem in computer vision, Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (PASS) aims to give complete scene perception based on an ultra-wide angle of view. Most PASS methods often focus on spherical geometry with RGB input or using the depth information in original or HHA format, which does not make full use of panoramic image geometry. To address these shortcomings, we propose REL-SF4PASS with our REL depth representation based on cylindrical coordinate and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion SMMF. REL is made up of Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, and Lateral Orientation Angle, which fully represents 3D space in cylindrical coordinate style and the surface normal direction. SMMF aims to ensure the diversity of fusion for different panoramic image regions and reduce the breakage of cylinder side surface expansion in ERP projection, which uses different fusion strategies to match the different regions in panoramic images. Experimental results show that REL-SF4PASS considerably improves performance and robustness on popular benchmark, Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets. It gains 2.35% average mIoU improvement on all 3 folds and reduces the performance variance by approximately 70% when facing 3D disturbance.",

This work presents a novel approach for detecting spinal ligament landmarks, which first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae and subsequently applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of attachment points. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches by achieving high accuracy and demonstrating strong generalization across all spinal regions.

We evaluate P-Tokens across two editing datasets and three LLMs, demonstrating performance comparable to, and often exceeding, IKE. We further find that editing performance is robust to distractors with small negative effects to neighboring facts, and that increasing the number of P-Tokens improves performance.

We introduce Generative Traffic Agents (GTA) for simulating large-scale, context-sensitive transportation choices using LLM-powered, persona-based agents. GTA generates artificial populations from census-based sociodemographic data. It simulates activity schedules and mode choices, enabling scalable, human-like simulations without handcrafted rules. We evaluate GTA in Berlin-scale experiments, comparing simulation results against empirical data. While agents replicate patterns, such as modal split by socioeconomic status, they show systematic biases in trip length and mode preference. GTA offers new opportunities for modeling how future innovations, from bike lanes to transit apps, shape mobility decisions.",

      "abstract": "Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a core challenge in continual learning, requiring models to rapidly adapt to new classes with very limited samples while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks. Experiments on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets demonstrate that CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and while significantly reducing the parameter overhead.",

Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BrepARG validates the feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences, opening new directions for B-rep generation.",

We study the intersection of these issues and ask: do hallucination detectors suffer from the low-resource effect? We conduct experiments on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities). Experiments with four LLMs and three hallucination detectors reveal a curious finding: As expected, the task accuracies in low-resource languages experience large drops (compared to English). However, the drop in detectors' accuracy is often several times smaller than the drop in task accuracy. Our findings suggest that even in low-resource languages, the internal mechanisms of LLMs might encode signals about their uncertainty. Further, the detectors are robust within language (even for non-English) and in multilingual setups, but not in cross-lingual settings without in-language supervision.",

In this work, we propose a projection-based method to enforce hard constraints and establish a state-dependent Lipschitz continuity property for the optimal MPC cost function, which enables sharp convergence analysis of the closed-loop system. For the first time, we derive explicit bounds on ReLU network width and depth for approximating MPC policies with guaranteed closed-loop performance. To further reduce network complexity and enhance closed-loop performance, we propose a non-uniform error framework with a state-aware scaling function to adaptively adjust both the input and output of the ReLU network.

To mitigate the problem, emerging probabilistic approaches treat the 3D estimations as a distribution, taking into account the uncertainty measurement of the poses. Falling in a similar category, we proposed FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method based on the flow matching generative approach. Conditioned on the 2D cues, the flow matching scheme learns the optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. The 2D lifting condition is modeled via graph convolutional networks, leveraging the learnable connections between human body joints as the graph structure for feature aggregation. Compared to diffusion-based methods, the FMPose with optimal transport produces faster and more accurate 3D pose generations. Experimental results show major improvements of our FMPose over current state-of-the-art methods on three common benchmarks for 3D human pose estimation, namely Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW.",

      "abstract": "Longitudinal information in radiology reports refers to the sequential tracking of findings across multiple examinations over time, which is crucial for monitoring disease progression and guiding clinical decisions. Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models. Using this new benchmark, we assessed seven state-of-the-art report generation models. Our LLM-based annotation method outperforms existing annotation solutions, achieving 11.3\\% and 5.3\\% higher F1-scores for longitudinal information detection and disease tracking, respectively.",

      "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time novel view synthesis. As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.",

      "abstract": "Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (CSAS) provides a 360° azimuth view of the seabed, surpassing the limited aperture and mono-view image of conventional side-scan SAS. This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory. A space-carving reconstruction method is applied to infer the 3D shape of the object from the segmented shadows. The results demonstrate the potential of shadows in circular SAS for improving target analysis and 3D reconstruction.",

LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.",

Accurate causal models provide a means to enhance the interpretability of predictive models, and furthermore a basis for counterfactual and interventional reasoning and the estimation of treatment effects. However, would-be practitioners of causal discovery face a dizzying array of algorithms without a clear best choice. This abundance of competitive algorithms makes ensembling a natural choice for practical applications. At the same time, real-world use cases frequently face challenges that violate the assumptions of common causal discovery algorithms, forcing heavy reliance on expert knowledge. Inspired by recent work on dynamically requested expert knowledge and LLMs as experts, we present a flexible model averaging method leveraging dynamically requested expert knowledge to ensemble a diverse array of causal discovery algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method with imperfect experts such as LLMs on both clean and noisy data. We also analyze the impact of different degrees of expert correctness and assess the capabilities of LLMs for clinical causal discovery, providing valuable insights for practitioners.",

We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.\n  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning. We establish a new baseline of 11.3 percent CER on the PHTD (Persian) dataset. Applying CER-HV improves the evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6 percent on the cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8 percent on the noisier ones. Although our experiments focus on documents written in an Arabic-script language, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Ajami, and Pashto, the framework is general and can be applied to other text recognition datasets.",

However, to deliver such assistance, accurate prediction of the user's joint torques is essential. In this work, we propose a feature extraction pipeline using 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to predict elbow and shoulder joint torques. For preliminary evaluation, this pipeline was integrated into two neural network models: the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Data were collected from a single subject performing elbow and shoulder movements under three load conditions (0 kg, 1.10 kg, and 1.85 kg) using three motion-capture cameras. Reference torques were estimated from center-of-mass kinematics under the assumption of static equilibrium. Our offline analyses showed that, with our feature extraction pipeline, MLP model achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m, 1.403 N m, and 1.434 N m (over five seeds) for elbow, front-shoulder, and side-shoulder joints, respectively, which were comparable to the TCN performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to that of a network designed explicitly for temporal dependencies. This finding is particularly relevant for applications with limited training data, a common scenario patient care.",

While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier. We summarize a set of actionable implications for developers, organizations, and tool vendors seeking to advance artificial intelligence (AI) assisted software development.",

      "abstract": "In skeleton-based human activity understanding, existing methods often adopt the contrastive learning paradigm to construct a discriminative feature space. However, many of these approaches fail to exploit the structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples. In this study, we introduce ACLNet, an Affinity Contrastive Learning Network that explores the intricate clustering relationships among human activity classes to improve feature discrimination. Specifically, we propose an affinity metric to refine similarity measurements, thereby forming activity superclasses that provide more informative contrastive signals. A dynamic temperature schedule is also introduced to adaptively adjust the penalty strength for various superclasses. In addition, we employ a margin-based contrastive strategy to improve the separation of hard positive and negative samples within classes. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate the superiority of our method in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

Rather than using a fixed set of questions, EMemBench generates questions from each agent's own trajectory, covering both text and visual game environments. Each template computes verifiable ground truth from underlying game signals, with controlled answerability and balanced coverage over memory skills: single/multi-hop recall, induction, temporal, spatial, logical, and adversarial. We evaluate memory agents with strong LMs/VLMs as backbones, using in-context prompting as baselines. Across 15 text games and multiple visual seeds, results are far from saturated: induction and spatial reasoning are persistent bottlenecks, especially in visual setting. Persistent memory yields clear gains for open backbones on text games, but improvements are less consistent for VLM agents, suggesting that visually grounded episodic memory remains an open challenge. A human study further confirms the difficulty of EMemBench.",

By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback. We also construct a multi-domain perturbation-based benchmark covering five medical report datasets with diverse imaging modalities and controlled semantic variations. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentsEval delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under paraphrastic, semantic, and stylistic perturbations.

      "abstract": "The sample efficiency challenge in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) compromises its industrial adoption due to the high cost and time demands of real-world training. Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\\% for most workspace regions. We use augmented reality targets to improve the evaluation process efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate that the agent successfully generalizes to real objects of varying colors and shapes, including LEGO\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}~cubes and a mug. These results establish the proposed pipeline as an efficient, scalable solution to the sim-to-real problem.",

Hence audio classifiers are easy to manipulate or confuse, resulting in wrong classifications. While inducing a misclassification is not hard, until now the set of features that the classifiers rely on was not well understood.\n  In this paper we introduce a new method that uses causal reasoning to discover features of the frequency space that are sufficient and necessary for a given classification. We describe an implementation of this algorithm in the tool FreqReX and provide experimental results on a number of standard benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that causally sufficient and necessary subsets allow us to manipulate the outputs of the models in a variety of ways by changing the input very slightly. Namely, a change to one out of 240,000 frequencies results in a change in classification 58% of the time, and the change can be so small that it is practically inaudible. These results show that causal analysis is useful for understanding the reasoning process of audio classifiers and can be used to successfully manipulate their outputs.",

However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation. To enable effective training, we construct a large-scale dataset GCD-TS, comprising multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes and annotated sewing patterns. The dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic samples covering a wide range of complex geometries and topologies. Extensive experiments show that ReWeaver consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of topology accuracy, geometry alignment and seam-panel consistency.",

      "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to legal domain-specific tasks, evaluating their ability to perform legal work in real-world settings has become essential. However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.",

We attribute this to modality imbalance, where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence. To address this, we present ReViP, a novel VLA framework with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance to enhance visual grounding and robustness under perturbations. The key insight is to introduce auxiliary task-aware environment priors to adaptively modulate the coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics. Specifically, we use an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues from visual observations, which drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to enhance environmental awareness and reduce state-driven errors. Moreover, to evaluate false completion, we propose the first False-Completion Benchmark Suite built on LIBERO with controlled settings such as Object-Drop. Extensive experiments show that ReViP effectively reduces false-completion rates and improves success rates over strong VLA baselines on our suite, with gains extending to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations.",

Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in terms of its comprehensiveness, scale, and language coverage on how to improve code translation accuracy using code comments.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) has recently attracted significant attention by leveraging the expressive power of large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models (DMs). A central practical challenge is resolving the trade-off between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism. To address inference efficiency, many recent works have explored knowledge distillation strategies specifically tailored to SR, enabling one-step diffusion-based approaches. However, these teacher-student formulations are inherently constrained by information compression, which can degrade perceptual cues such as lifelike textures and depth of field, even with high overall perceptual quality. In parallel, self-distillation DMs, known as Flow Map models, have emerged as a promising alternative for image generation tasks, enabling fast inference while preserving the expressivity and training stability of standard DMs. Building on these developments, we propose FlowMapSR, a novel diffusion-based framework for image super-resolution explicitly designed for efficient inference. Beyond adapting Flow Map models to SR, we introduce two complementary enhancements: (i) positive-negative prompting guidance, based on a generalization of classifier free-guidance paradigm to Flow Map models, and (ii) adversarial fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Among the considered Flow Map formulations (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Shortcut), we find that the Shortcut variant consistently achieves the best performance when combined with these enhancements. Extensive experiments show that FlowMapSR achieves a better balance between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism than recent state-of-the-art methods for both x4 and x8 upscaling, while maintaining competitive inference time. Notably, a single model is used for both upscaling factors, without any scale-specific conditioning or degradation-guided mechanisms.",

However, in real-world settings where models are frequently updated, existing counterfactual explanations can quickly become invalid or unreliable. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistically Safe CEs (PSCE), a method for generating counterfactual explanations that are $δ$-safe, to ensure high predictive confidence, and $ε$-robust to ensure low predictive variance. Based on Bayesian principles, PSCE provides formal probabilistic guarantees for CEs under model changes which are adhered to in what we refer to as the $\\langle δ, ε\\rangle$-set. Uncertainty-aware constraints are integrated into our optimization framework and we validate our method empirically across diverse datasets. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art Bayesian CE methods, where PSCE produces counterfactual explanations that are not only more plausible and discriminative, but also provably robust under model change.",

While trust is likely to play a central role in enabling these informal and unsupervised interactions, we still lack an understanding of how people develop and experience it in this context. Seeking to fill this gap, we recruited 24 frequent users of generative AI for emotional support and conducted a qualitative study consisting of diary entries about interactions, transcripts of chats with AI, and in-depth interviews. Our results suggest important novel drivers of trust in this context: familiarity emerging from personalisation, nuanced mental models of generative AI, and awareness of people's control over conversations. Notably, generative AI's homogeneous use of personalised, positive, and persuasive language appears to promote some of these trust-building factors. However, this also seems to discourage other trust-related behaviours, such as remembering that generative AI is a machine trained to converse in human language. We present implications for future research that are likely to become critical as the use of generative AI for emotional support increasingly overlaps with therapeutic work.",

We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model.

Although separability appears in the residual stream and MLPs, steering using these probes is most effective in a sparse subset of middle-layer attention heads. Using TruthfulQA as the base dataset, we find that probes trained on it transfer effectively to other factual QA benchmarks. Furthermore, comparing our discovered direction to previously identified \"truthful\" directions reveals limited overlap, suggesting that factual accuracy, and deference resistance, arise from related but distinct mechanisms. Attention-pattern analysis further indicates that the influential heads attend disproportionately to expressions of user doubt, contributing to sycophantic shifts. Overall, these findings suggest that sycophancy can be mitigated through simple, targeted linear interventions that exploit the internal geometry of attention activations.",

While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Nuclei panoptic segmentation supports cancer diagnostics by integrating both semantic and instance segmentation of different cell types to analyze overall tissue structure and individual nuclei in histopathology images. Major challenges include detecting small objects, handling ambiguous boundaries, and addressing class imbalance. To address these issues, we propose PanopMamba, a novel hybrid encoder-decoder architecture that integrates Mamba and Transformer with additional feature-enhanced fusion via state space modeling. We design a multiscale Mamba backbone and a State Space Model (SSM)-based fusion network to enable efficient long-range perception in pyramid features, thereby extending the pure encoder-decoder framework while facilitating information sharing across multiscale features of nuclei. The proposed SSM-based feature-enhanced fusion integrates pyramid feature networks and dynamic feature enhancement across different spatial scales, enhancing the feature representation of densely overlapping nuclei in both semantic and spatial dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Mamba-based approach for panoptic segmentation. Additionally, we introduce alternative evaluation metrics, including image-level Panoptic Quality ($i$PQ), boundary-weighted PQ ($w$PQ), and frequency-weighted PQ ($fw$PQ), which are specifically designed to address the unique challenges of nuclei segmentation and thereby mitigate the potential bias inherent in vanilla PQ. Experimental evaluations on two multiclass nuclei segmentation benchmark datasets, MoNuSAC2020 and NuInsSeg, demonstrate the superiority of PanopMamba for nuclei panoptic segmentation over state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, the robustness of PanopMamba is validated across various metrics, while the distinctiveness of PQ variants is also demonstrated.

However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion. On the VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, experimental results show the better performances of BPIM compared to the baseline Yolov5-P2, and obtains the promising performance in the state-of-the-art methods with comparable computation load.",

Its first step decomposes the hyperspectral image into abundances and endmembers by unmixing. Then, an abundance super-resolution neural network is trained using synthetic abundances, which are generated using the dead leaves model in such a way as to faithfully mimic real abundance statistics. Next, the spatial resolution of the considered hyperspectral image abundances is increased using this trained network, and the high resolution hyperspectral image is finally obtained by recombination with the endmembers. Experimental results show the training potential of the synthetic images, and demonstrate the method effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Learning a stationary diffusion amounts to estimating the parameters of a stochastic differential equation whose stationary distribution matches a target distribution. We build on the recently introduced kernel deviation from stationarity (KDS), which enforces stationarity by evaluating expectations of the diffusion's generator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Leveraging the connection between KDS and Stein discrepancies, we introduce the Stein-type KDS (SKDS) as an alternative formulation. We prove that a vanishing SKDS guarantees alignment of the learned diffusion's stationary distribution with the target. Furthermore, under broad parametrizations, SKDS is convex with an empirical version that is $ε$-quasiconvex with high probability. Empirically, learning with SKDS attains comparable accuracy to KDS while substantially reducing computational cost and yields improvements over the majority of competitive baselines.",

      "abstract": "As the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts from parameter scaling to inference-time collaboration, the Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) framework has emerged as a general paradigm to harness collective intelligence by layering diverse models. While recent MoA variants have introduced dynamic routing and residual connections to improve efficiency, these methods often fail to facilitate deep semantic interaction between agents, limiting the system's ability to actively correct hallucinations and refine logic. In this paper, we introduce Attention-MoA, a novel MoA-based framework that redefines collaboration through Inter-agent Semantic Attention. Complemented by an Inter-layer Residual Module with Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism, our architecture mitigates information degradation in deep layers while improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK demonstrate that Attention-MoA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 91.15% Length-Controlled Win Rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and dominating in 10 out of 12 capabilities on FLASK. Notably, Attention-MoA enables an ensemble of small open-source models to outperform massive proprietary models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, achieving an MT-Bench score of 8.83 and an AlpacaEval 2.0 LC Win Rate of 77.36%.",

      "abstract": "Train delays result from complex interactions between operational, technical, and environmental factors. While weather impacts railway reliability, particularly in Nordic regions, existing datasets rarely integrate meteorological information with operational train data. This study presents the first publicly available dataset combining Finnish railway operations with synchronized meteorological observations from 2018-2024. The dataset integrates operational metrics from Finland Digitraffic Railway Traffic Service with weather measurements from 209 environmental monitoring stations, using spatial-temporal alignment via Haversine distance. It encompasses 28 engineered features across operational variables and meteorological measurements, covering approximately 38.5 million observations from Finland's 5,915-kilometer rail network. Preprocessing includes strategic missing data handling through spatial fallback algorithms, cyclical encoding of temporal features, and robust scaling of weather data to address sensor outliers. Analysis reveals distinct seasonal patterns, with winter months exhibiting delay rates exceeding 25\\% and geographic clustering of high-delay corridors in central and northern Finland. Furthermore, the work demonstrates applications of the data set in analysing the reliability of railway traffic in Finland. A baseline experiment using XGBoost regression achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 2.73 minutes for predicting station-specific delays, demonstrating the dataset's utility for machine learning applications. The dataset enables diverse applications, including train delay prediction, weather impact assessment, and infrastructure vulnerability mapping, providing researchers with a flexible resource for machine learning applications in railway operations research.",

      "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing mimics brain-inspired mechanisms through spiking neurons and energy-efficient processing, offering a pathway to efficient in-memory computing (IMC). However, these advancements raise critical security and privacy concerns. As the adoption of bio-inspired architectures and memristive devices increases, so does the urgency to assess the vulnerability of these emerging technologies to hardware and software attacks. Emerging architectures introduce new attack surfaces, particularly due to asynchronous, event-driven processing and stochastic device behavior. The integration of memristors into neuromorphic hardware and software implementations in spiking neural networks offers diverse possibilities for advanced computing architectures, including their role in security-aware applications. This survey systematically analyzes the security landscape of neuromorphic systems, covering attack methodologies, side-channel vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. We focus on both hardware and software concerns relevant to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and hardware primitives, such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) for cryptographic and secure computation applications. We approach this analysis from diverse perspectives, from attack methodologies to countermeasure strategies that integrate efficiency and protection in brain-inspired hardware. This review not only maps the current landscape of security threats but provides a foundation for developing secure and trustworthy neuromorphic architectures.",

      "abstract": "Low-complexity multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection remains a key challenge in modern wireless systems, particularly for 5G reduced capability (RedCap) and internet-of-things (IoT) devices. In this context, the growing interest in deploying machine learning on edge devices must be balanced against stringent constraints on computational complexity and memory while supporting high-order modulation. Beyond accurate hard detection, reliable soft information is equally critical, as modern receivers rely on soft-input channel decoding, imposing additional requirements on the detector design. In this work, we propose recurSIC, a lightweight learning-based MIMO detection framework that is structurally inspired by successive interference cancellation (SIC) and incorporates learned processing stages. It generates reliable soft information via multi-path hypothesis tracking with a tunable complexity parameter while requiring only a single forward pass and a minimal parameter count. Numerical results in realistic wireless scenarios show that recurSIC achieves strong hard- and soft-detection performance at very low complexity, making it well suited for edge-constrained MIMO receivers.",
